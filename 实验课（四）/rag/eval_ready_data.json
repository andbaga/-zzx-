It can occur in virtually any organ or tissue, including the brain, breast, prostate, lung, colon, stomach, adrenal glands, thyroid, bladder, cervix, ovaries, and skin. A tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign), and not all tumors will appear on certain diagnostic imaging tests like a PET scan, though they may be visible on others such as an MRI. Its formation is often due to somatic mutations.\\n\\nThe specific characteristics of a tumor are central to medical diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Key factors include its size, location, histological grade, and depth of invasion into surrounding tissues. For example, a tumor may be described as larger than 4 cm or 5 cm and may invade nearby structures like bone, sinuses, pelvic floor muscles (e.g., levator ani), the anus, or other organs. These features determine if it is locoregional, locally advanced, or has metastasized, and directly influence whether it is classified as resectable or unresectable. In specific cancers, such as ovarian or cervical cancer, the tumor's size or location can preclude initial surgery.\\n\\nDiagnostic methods to evaluate a tumor include physical examination, biopsy (including open biopsy to confirm histology), imaging studies, and endoscopic procedures. A tumor can cause symptoms by pressing on nearby organs, obstructing passages, or producing hormones. The primary goal of treatment is to remove or damage the tumor through surgery, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or endocrine therapy, which can slow or shrink its growth. Pathologists play a key role in examining and staging the tumor after removal. The risk of cancer recurrence is often higher with deeper invasion.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Squamous Cell Skin Cancer (CSCC)\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Squamous cell skin cancer is a type of skin cancer for which several treatments are described.<SEP>Squamous Cell Skin Cancer is a type of cancer that can be regional (spread to lymph nodes) or metastatic.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC), also known as squamous cell skin cancer, is a very common type of skin cancer.

Specific associated risks include squamous cell skin cancer, anal cancer (due to hindered HPV clearance), and primary CNS lymphoma. Furthermore, certain cancers, like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), originate in immune cells like lymphocytes.\\n\\nIn medical treatment, the immune system itself is a therapeutic target.

This fundamental process, driven by genetic mutations, results in cancerous tumors that can crowd out normal cells, impair organ function, and potentially spread to other areas, such as lymph nodes. Cancer can originate in numerous primary locations, including the breast, colon, lungs, prostate, cervix, skin, ovaries, testicles, head and neck, urinary tract, rectum, base of the skull, and lymph nodes. Specific types include invasive breast cancer, cervical cancer, small cell lung cancer, and colon cancer.\\n\\nDiagnosis and medical planning require determining the cancer's exact type, origin, genetic profile, and stage. This involves diagnostic procedures like biopsy and cystoscopy, imaging tests such as CT, MRI, and PET scans (where MRI is specifically used to check treatment results and see if the cancer has spread), and laboratory and genetic testing. A family history of cancer is a significant risk factor. Cancer itself, along with recent abdominal surgery, is also a recognized risk factor for developing secondary conditions like Deep Vein Thrombosis.\\n\\nTreatment is highly tailored and may involve a combination of systemic and localized therapies managed by specialists like Medical and Radiation Oncologists. Options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemoradiation, as well as clinical trials. The approach varies; for instance, colon or rectal cancer may necessitate surgical removal, while some cancers are not surgically removable. Treatments can have significant side effects, including damage to reproductive organs affecting fertility, and cause substantial psychological distress such as depression and anxiety. The stress associated with cancer can also make behaviors like quitting smoking more difficult. Comprehensive care therefore integrates supportive measures, palliative care, and management of patient misconceptions about clinical trials to manage symptoms, side effects, and overall well-being.

This metastatic progression distinguishes it from localized disease and necessitates a more intensive management strategy.\\n\\nThe primary and recommended treatment for regional CSCC is surgical removal of the cancerous tissue from the lymph nodes. This is often followed by adjuvant therapy, a combined approach aimed at addressing any residual microscopic disease to improve outcomes. Due to its advanced and metastatic nature, regional CSCC requires more vigilant and frequent post-treatment monitoring compared to localized cancer. This monitoring typically involves regular follow-up physical examinations and imaging tests, such as CT scans, to detect any potential recurrence or further progression at the earliest possible stage.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Health Issues\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Health issues refer to medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes that family members may have experienced.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"NCCN Guidelines For Patients: Squamous Cell Skin Cancer\", \"type\": \"content\", \"description\": \"A specific set of patient guidelines for treating cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip.<SEP>A specific set of patient guidelines for treating cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip.<SEP>The NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Squamous Cell Skin Cancer provide treatment information for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Skin Cancer Screening\", \"type\": \"method\", \"description\": \"Skin cancer screening is a regular examination recommended for individuals with conditions that increase skin cancer risk.<SEP>Skin cancer screening is a regular medical examination recommended for individuals with conditions that weaken the immune system.<SEP>Skin cancer screening is a regular examination recommended for individuals with conditions that increase skin cancer risk.<SEP>Skin cancer screening is a regular medical examination recommended for individuals with conditions that weaken the immune system.<SEP>A regular examination recommended for individuals with a weakened immune system to check for skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Very High-Risk CSCC\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Very high-risk CSCC, or very high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, is a specific classification of squamous cell skin cancer.

type of skin cancer.It is highly treatable and can often be cured.Squamous cell skin cancer is a common skin cancer, especially in fair-skinned people.It is the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma.The third type—melanoma—is much less common than the other types but can be more aggressive.Because they do not behave like melanoma, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are often referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancers or keratinocyte carcinomas.Cancer that starts in a squamous cell is called a squamous cell carcinoma.Squamous cells are found in the top layer of the skin.They can also be found in other areas of the body, such as the lungs, thyroid, and esophagus.These types are treated differently than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Squamous cell skin cancers often begin as scaly patches on the skin that can become solid and misshapen.This cancer is also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).This patient guide is about squamous cell skin cancer only.The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide.Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body.Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold.Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin).Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue.Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis.There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"Most people who have bladder cancer are aged 55 years and over.Bladder cancer is often found at an early stage when the cancer is highly treatable.However, bladder cancer commonly comes back again even after treatment.In many cases, bladder cancer comes back in a different place and sometimes more advanced than before.That’s why follow-up testing is so important.People with bladder cancer need regular follow-up tests for many years to check if the cancer has returned.The most common kind of bladder cancer starts in the urothelial cells, which are stretchy cells that line the inside of the bladder.Urothelial cells also form the inner layer in the rest of the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, the ureters, and the urethra.Cancer of the urothelium can start in these areas instead of the bladder, although it’s less common.Other (non-urothelial) types of bladder cancer are much less common.These include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.How is bladder cancer found?Bladder cancer is usually found when a person has symptoms.A symptom is a problem or feeling that may signal a disease or condition.The most common symptom of bladder cancer, and the one that usually appears first, is having blood in your urine (hematuria).How does blood get into urine?Bladder tumors are likely to release a little blood, which mixes with the urine in your bladder.The blood may turn your urine pink or bright red.Or, if there isn’t enough blood to be visible, your urine may look normal.But your clinical team can still detect blood by looking at a sample of the urine under a microscope.Blood in the urine can be caused by many other things besides bladder cancer.The most common cause is an infection in the urinary tract.So anyone with blood in their urine should see a health care provider to get their urine tested.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"About basal cell skin cancer What is basal cell skin cancer?How is basal cell skin cancer treated?What can you do to get the best care?Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer.About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States.The good news is it can be cured in most cases.Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer.Keep reading to find out more.What is basal cell skin cancer?Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types.If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable.This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads).Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis).The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells.Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control.This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk.But it can occur anywhere on the body.Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck.Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek.Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet?Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature.It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin).Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles.Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue.Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis.It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"Most

may be taken from the rounded, bottom part of the cervix (ectocervix) and/or from the endocervical canal.The removed tissue is examined by a specialized doctor called a pathologist.A pathologist is a

How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface. Melanocytes – Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin. Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"recommended. If you can have it, radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is recommended. Platinumbased chemotherapy is a recommended option for use with radiation. If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may damage healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial may also be an option. A clinical trial could involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy.  See Part 6: When treatment is over for information on monitoring and follow-up care. Metastatic squamous cell skin cancer Cancer cells can spread through blood and lymph to form tumors in other areas of the body. This is called metastasis. Squamous cell skin cancer does not metastasize often. For this reason, there is not much research on the best way to treat metastatic squamous cell skin cancer. A discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended to consider your treatment options. If surgery and/or radiation therapy cannot remove metastatic CSCC, systemic therapy is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial for systemic therapy is another option. A clinical trial could involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Help for symptoms Radiation therapy and/or surgery may be used to treat distant tumors that are causing pain or other bothersome side effects. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a special radiation technique that may be used in some cases. It sends high doses of radiation to small areas to kill cancer cells and is typically given over 3 to 5 treatments. Key points Squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes is called “regional”. Your care team will test suspicious lymph nodes to determine how far the disease has spread. Testing could also include scans of your upper body, stomach, and pelvis to check for any metastatic disease (spread) to those areas. The best way to treat regional CSCC is with surgery to remove the tumor and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is often given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells. If surgery is not possible or not recommended, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or a combination of both may be options\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"Squamous cell skin cancer is most commonly caused by getting sunburns or spending too much time in the sun over many years.h An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin that has a higher chance of becoming squamous cell skin cancer.You may be more likely to get squamous cell skin cancer if you have actinic keratoses, a weakened immune system, or certain genetic syndromes.Squamous cell skin cancer can form in old wounds, burns, or scars.This is called Marjolin’s ulcer and it can be harder to treat.Testing for CSCC could include a full health history, an examination of any lesions, and a skin biopsy to remove a sample and test it for cancer.Imaging scans will also be done if cancer goes deeper into the skin or has spread to other parts of the body.Cancer cells can travel through blood and lymph fluid to form tumors in other parts of the body.If spread to lymph nodes is suspected, your doctor will do a lymph node biopsy.2 Types of treatments Who is on my care team?Superficial treatments Surgery Radiation therapy Systemic therapy Clinical trials Key points This chapter describes the types of treatment you may have for squamous cell skin cancer.The best treatment for you will depend on the extent of the cancer, whether surgery is a suitable option, and your personal preferences.Not everyone will receive the same treatment.Who is on my care team?After being diagnosed with squamous cell skin cancer, knowing what to do next can be confusing.Aside from your oncologist (your cancer doctor), there are others who may be involved in your cancer care.Some members of your care team will be with you throughout your treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it.Get to know your care team and let them get to know you.Depending on your diagnosis, your care team might include the following: Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer.They also do skin exams and can teach you how to do them on your own.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"to you.

Treatment should involve a team of digestive health experts with experience in chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and imaging. Everyone with anal cancer is encouraged to consider enrolling in a clinical trial for treatment if available. Anal cancer most often starts in squamous cells lining the canal that leads from the skin surface into the rectum. Cancer that forms in squamous cells is known as squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are found in the tissues that form the surface of the skin and in other areas of the body. Most colorectal cancers, in contrast, start in glandular cells and are called adenocarcinomas. This difference is important in determining treatment options. Anal squamous cell carcinoma is the focus of this patient guide. Other rare types not covered here include anal adenocarcinoma and anal melanoma. NCCN Guidelines for Patients® are available on rectal cancer and melanoma. The anus The anus is the opening through which feces (also called stool) exit the body. It is located at the very end of the large intestine (bowel). The colon is the first and longest section of the large bowel. The rectum is defined as the last several inches of the large bowel. Stool is held in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus are located within the pelvis. The pelvis is the area of the body between the hip bones, below the abdomen. Other organs in the pelvis include The anus The anus is the opening through which stool exits the body. Anal cancer starts in either the anal canal or the perianal region.

Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun.

Sun exposure Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over a long period of time, frequent tanning, and getting sunburns. Indoor tanning Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer. Using all types of indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds) increases the risk of getting any type of skin cancer. Environmental toxins People who are often exposed to pollutants such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be found in soil, water, and air) can experience skin damage that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns. This is known as Marjolin’s ulcer. CSCC that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come back after treatment. Actinic keratoses An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin caused by exposure to the sun over time that may become squamous cell skin cancer. Actinic keratoses vary in appearance, and may be red, white, tan, or pink in color. They may appear as small scaly spots (lesions) or stick out from the skin like bumps. Some may even look like warts. Having actinic keratoses means you are at increased risk of developing squamous cell skin cancer. It is important that you have your skin looked at by a doctor or dermatologist. Actinic keratosis on the hand An actinic keratosis is an area of rough skin caused by being in the sun over time.

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care.

How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface. Melanocytes – Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin.

treat superficial tumors.Photons are used to treat deeper, more invasive tumors.In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed close to or in direct contact with the tumor for a short period of time.Uses for radiation therapy Radiation therapy is an option for people after resection (surgery) of their cancer, or for those who cannot or choose not to have surgery.However, radiation therapy can be very effective for small tumors, and for tumors in areas such as the head and neck.Radiation therapy should not be used in people who have certain genetic conditions that put them at higher risk of skin cancer caused by radiation, such as basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum.It may also not be appropriate for some people who have connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma.The same area generally should not be treated with radiation more than once.When CSCC grows in a radiated area, it usually needs to be removed with surgery.However, the area often doesn’t heal as well because the tissues were weakened by the radiation.This is especially true for CSCC on the scalp.A radiation oncologist should help you determine whether this treatment is appropriate for you.Adjuvant therapy refers to therapy that is given after primary treatment to lower the risk that cancer will come back.Radiation is sometimes used as adjuvant therapy after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells, or to help prevent recurrence for patients with high-risk tumors.Side effects of radiation therapy The most common short-term side effects of radiation are skin redness, itching, mild discomfort, and feeling tired.These side effects are worse at the end of the radiation course and take several weeks to go away.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"About basal

more extensive than surgery on the skin and is usually done while you are under general anesthesia (in a deep sleep).Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to which cancer cells most likely spread from a primary tumor.Sometimes, there is more than one sentinel lymph node.A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgery that removes tissue samples to examine

It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. This book is only about basal cell skin cancer. For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Signs and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it’s most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes. In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don’t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk.

This book will refer to the oropharynx as the throat. The pharynx The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The pharynx has 3 parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Anatomyof thePharynx Head and neck cancers Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Cancer is named and treated based on the tumor location or where the cancer started. Cancer can occur in the: Mouth (oral cavity), Middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), Upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), Voice box (larynx), or Lower part of the throat behind the larynx (hypopharynx). Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN or HNSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer. It forms in the thin, flat cells of the mucus membranes of the mouth (oral), nose (nasal), and throat (pharynx). Mucus is a thick, slippery fluid. Squamous cells are found throughout the body, including the skin.

The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide. Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.

Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour. The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells.

Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease.

Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information.

Tumors on other areas of the body Surgery is the best way to treat tumors that have spread to other areas of the body if possible. Surgery removes the tumor and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells. This is important if there was more than one lymph node with cancer, or if cancer was found to have grown through the protective outer layer of any lymph nodes removed during surgery. If surgery is not an option If you cannot have surgery, a discussion between different cancer doctors to consider your treatment options is recommended. If you can have it, radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is recommended. Platinumbased chemotherapy is a recommended option for use with radiation. If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may damage healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial may also be an option.

Its significant medical importance is particularly evident in oncology and diagnosis. The neck is a primary site for the development of certain cancers, most notably basal cell skin cancer, and is a common location for the spread of head and neck cancers, including follicular lymphoma.\\n\\nDue to its dense network of lymph nodes, the neck is routinely examined for abnormalities. During a physical exam, an oncologist may palpate the area to assess for swelling or enlargement of these nodes. Imaging techniques like CT or MRI scans are also key for evaluation. In oncological staging, the neck serves as a crucial anatomical boundary; the spread of cancer to its lymph nodes is classified as a regional metastasis, which is distinct from and less serious than a distant metastasis beyond this area. This distinction directly influences treatment decisions.\\n\\nThe neck's structures are also directly involved in specific therapies. For instance, thyroid cells, both cancerous and normal, located in the neck can be targeted by Radioactive Iodine (RAI) therapy. Furthermore, cancer spread within the neck can cause clinical symptoms like pain or stiffness, which may be alleviated with treatments such as radiation therapy.

A tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign), and not all tumors will appear on certain diagnostic imaging tests like a PET scan, though they may be visible on others such as an MRI. Its formation is often due to somatic mutations.\\n\\nThe specific characteristics of a tumor are central to medical diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Key factors include its size, location, histological grade, and depth of invasion into surrounding tissues. For example, a tumor may be described as larger than 4 cm or 5 cm and may invade nearby structures like bone, sinuses, pelvic floor muscles (e.g., levator ani), the anus, or other organs. These features determine if it is locoregional, locally advanced, or has metastasized, and directly influence whether it is classified as resectable or unresectable. In specific cancers, such as ovarian or cervical cancer, the tumor's size or location can preclude initial surgery.\\n\\nDiagnostic methods to evaluate a tumor include physical examination, biopsy (including open biopsy to confirm histology), imaging studies, and endoscopic procedures. A tumor can cause symptoms by pressing on nearby organs, obstructing passages, or producing hormones. The primary goal of treatment is to remove or damage the tumor through surgery, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or endocrine therapy, which can slow or shrink its growth.

How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface.

They are also used for actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions) that are in the same general area as the Bowen’s lesion. Photodynamic therapy In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a lightsensitive drug is applied to the area. When exposed to light (either red or blue light in the doctor’s office, or shaded outdoor light), the drug becomes active and kills cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy A drug applied to the skin becomes active and kills cancer cells when exposed to light. Common side effects of PDT include itching or burning when the liquid is applied, pain during the red or blue light exposure, and itching and redness for a few days after treatment. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy (also called cryosurgery) freezes and destroys precancerous and cancerous cells using a very cold liquid or tool. Liquid nitrogen is often used.

The nasal cavity is the space inside the nose. It lies above the bone that forms the roof of the mouth (hard palate) and curves down at the back to join the throat. The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of the throat, and the base of the tongue found in the throat. The pharynx The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The pharynx has 3 parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Anatomy of the Pharynx Head and neck cancer Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Cancer is named and treated based on the tumor location or where the cancer started. Cancer can occur in the Mouth (oral cavity), Middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), Upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), Voice box (larynx), or Lower part of the throat near the larynx (hypopharynx).

It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface. Melanocytes – Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin. Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin, and eye color. It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. This book is only about basal cell skin cancer. For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Signs and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it’s most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes. In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don’t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk.

Cryotherapy sometimes causes a burning sensation during treatment. A blister and scab will form, which heals over 2 to 3 weeks. Skin darkening or lightening can happen while it is healing. Topical therapies Topical therapies are treatments that are applied to the skin. 5-fluorouracil (Carac, Efudex, Fluoroplex) and imiquimod (Aldara) are prescription creams used to treat early CSCC and actinic keratoses. 5-fluorouracil (also called 5-FU) is chemotherapy applied directly to the skin, unlike most chemotherapy that is put into the bloodstream. A cream called calcipotriene (Sorilux, Dovonex) is often used with 5-fluorouracil to treat actinic keratosis. Calcipotriene is a form of vitamin D that activates the skin’s immune system. Imiquimod belongs to a group of drugs known as immune response modifiers. This cream can help fight abnormal skin growths by activating the immune system to damage abnormal skin cells. Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) is another topical therapy used to treat actinic keratosis. Tirbanibulin is a type of medication called a microtubule inhibitor. It works by killing fast-growing cells, such as the abnormal cells that cause actinic keratoses. It is applied to the face or scalp 1 time a day for 5 days in a row (consecutive) using a single-dose packet with each application. Thickening of the outer layer of skin is known as hyperkeratosis.

Similarly, specific lifestyle, chemical exposure, health conditions, and family history are associated with pancreatic cancer, and age and family history are key factors for prostate cancer. Risk factors for liver cancer also fall into these general categories of activities, environmental elements, and inherited traits.\\n\\nIn a separate but related clinical context, the term \\\"risk factors\\\" also refers to specific pathological or clinical features of a diagnosed cancer itself. These are characteristics, such as tumor size, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), or surgical margin status, which oncologists evaluate to estimate the likelihood of cancer recurrence. This assessment directly informs treatment decisions, such as whether to recommend external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) after surgery.\\n\\nFurthermore, patient-specific characteristics like age and overall health status are considered risk factors that influence the selection of treatment options and predicted outcomes, bridging the concepts of disease development and post-diagnosis management.<SEP>Elements that increase the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, such as age and family history, though they do not directly cause the disease.<SEP>Variables that increase the likelihood of developing a disease or experiencing a poor outcome.<SEP>Characteristics such as tumor size and the presence of LVSI that a doctor considers when determining the need for post-surgery EBRT.<SEP>Risk factors are elements that increase the likelihood of developing squamous cell skin cancer, listed as a section in the guide.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sunlight\", \"type\": \"naturalobject\", \"description\": \"Sunlight, particularly long-term exposure, is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer, especially for people who sunburn easily.<SEP>Sunlight, particularly long-term exposure, is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer, especially for people who sunburn easily.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"People With Light Skin Hair And Eyes\", \"type\": \"person\", \"description\": \"Individuals with light pigmentation who sunburn easily and are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Individuals with light pigmentation who sunburn easily and are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"UV Radiation\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Ultraviolet radiation from the sun or sources like tanning beds that can harm DNA inside basal skin cells, leading to abnormal cell growth.<SEP>Ultraviolet radiation from the sun or sources like tanning beds that can harm DNA inside basal skin cells, leading to abnormal cell growth.<SEP>UV radiation from the sun or sources like tanning beds can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells, leading to abnormal cell growth and basal cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sunlight/Outdoor Tanning\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Sunlight and outdoor tanning are major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer, especially from long-term sun exposure over many years, particularly for people who sunburn easily or work outdoors.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Light Eye Color\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Having a light eye color is a physical characteristic associated with a higher risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Having a light eye color is a physical characteristic associated with a higher risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Light eye color is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer, associated with lighter skin pigmentation.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sun Exposure\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Long-term exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation, a primary cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Long-term exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation, a primary cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Sun exposure over time is a cause of actinic keratosis and DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sun\", \"type\": \"naturalobject\", \"description\": \"The sun is a source of exposure that is commonly associated with the development of basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>The sun is a source of ultraviolet radiation;

For prostate cancer, age is consistently identified as the leading or biggest risk factor, with the likelihood of developing the disease increasing substantially as one gets older. Diagnosis is most common in individuals aged 65 years and above. In clinical practice, a patient's age is a critical component used alongside Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test results, digital rectal exam findings, family history, and race to assess individual risk and to determine the need for further diagnostic procedures, such as a biopsy. Age also directly influences the interpretation of PSA levels in screening, with higher levels generally considered more suspicious for cancer in older individuals.\\n\\nBeyond prostate cancer, age is a recognized risk factor for other malignancies. The risk of bladder cancer increases as a person gets older. Similarly, for basal cell skin cancer, advancing age represents a key risk factor, largely due to the cumulative lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Furthermore, a patient's age is utilized by doctors as one factor in assessing the likelihood of hereditary ovarian cancer.

It is most frequently caused by cumulative sun exposure over many years, with other major risk factors including indoor tanning and exposure to environmental toxins. It can also form within old wounds, burns, or scars.\\n\\nDiagnosis is confirmed through a skin biopsy. The disease is classified as local, regional, or metastatic, with the potential to spread to nearby lymph nodes. Treatment depends on the cancer's extent and risk classification. Primary treatments are surgical, including Mohs surgery and standard excision, often with lymph node assessment. Other options include radiation therapy and topical treatments.

It uses high-energy radiation, such as x-rays or particles, to destroy cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The primary delivery methods are External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (internal radiation). It is a local therapy, typically administered in multiple sessions over several weeks, with the goal of delivering a high dose to a tumor while limiting exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.\\n\\nIts roles in cancer care are versatile. It can serve as a primary treatment, an adjuvant treatment after surgery to reduce recurrence risk, or a palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms. It is often utilized when surgery is not an option, when cancer remains after surgery, or if cancer recurs in a previously operated area. It is frequently combined with other therapies, such as concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation). Radiation therapy is a standard part of treatment for a wide spectrum of cancers, including but not limited to anal cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, thyroid cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and cancers of the bladder, cervix, breast, head and neck, prostate, rectum, and lung. Specifically, it is a main treatment for primary CNS lymphoma and a listed treatment for thyroid cancer, particularly for cases that cannot be surgically removed, do not take up radioactive iodine, and are progressing.\\n\\nA significant aspect involves managing side effects from damage to nearby healthy tissues. These include short-term effects like skin irritation and fatigue, and long-term risks such as organ damage. Specific risks include damage to reproductive organs causing infertility (noted in anal cancer treatment), vaginal stenosis from pelvic radiation, impacts on fertility, and the development of secondary cancers, especially if administered at a young age.

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body.

This cancer is also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). This patient guide is about squamous cell skin cancer only. The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide. Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun.

The liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts work together to make, store, and secrete bile. Bile is a fluid that helps digest fat in the food you eat. The liver also filters your blood and makes other important substances called factors that help your body function normally. This chapter will discuss the liver and give an overview of liver cancer. The liver The liver is a large organ located on the right side of the body under the rib cage. Inside the liver is a network of blood and lymph vessels. The liver filters blood, helps with blood clotting, makes bile, breaks down fats, and helps process sugar for energy. The liver also produces lymph. Lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs. The liver has two lobes, a right and left lobe. Blood enters the liver from the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Blood leaves the liver through the hepatic veins before entering the inferior vena cava and returning to the heart. The gallbladder is located near the right side of the liver and close to the first part of the small intestines (duodenum). The liver and nearby organs The gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, and small intestine are found near the liver. Bile Liver cells make bile. Bile is a yellow or green fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts such as potassium and sodium, water, and other elements found in the body. It flows into small channels that drain into thin tubes called ducts. These ducts form larger and larger channels that flow into the left and right hepatic ducts. The left and right hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct. The common hepatic duct joins with the cystic duct that connects to the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is joined by the pancreatic duct just before it enters the small intestine.

Treatments for advanced-stage prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and other therapies. Early detection and treatment can greatly reduce the chances of getting advanced-stage prostate cancer. Many people with advancedstage prostate cancer continue to live their lives with the cancer and, in the end, may die from something else. Something to remember: When found early, prostate cancer has one of the highest survival rates of any cancer. Key points Prostate cancer develops when cells in the prostate gland grow out of control. Age is the biggest risk factor for prostate cancer. As you age, your chances of developing prostate cancer increase. Everyone with a prostate is at risk for prostate cancer. Not everyone with prostate cancer has symptoms. For most people, prostate cancer usually grows slowly and stays within the prostate.

Tests are used to plan treatment, check how well treatment is working, and monitor your health after treatment ends. This chapter will help you know what tests you may have and what to expect during testing. When you go for testing, bring someone with you to listen, ask questions, and write down the answers.

The risk level or category for skin cancer is usually based on the highest risk factor found. The following factors are used to determine your risk level. Location and size Squamous cell skin cancer on the head or neck is more likely to return after treatment than tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs. The following tumors are considered high risk because of their location and/or size: Tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs that are between 2 centimeters (cm) (about the size of a nickel) and 4 cm (about the size of a quarter) Any size tumor on the head, face, neck, hands, feet, shins, or sex organs The following tumors are considered very high risk because of their size: h Any tumor over 4 cm in any location Get to know your care team Keep the names and contact information for each member of your care team on hand, so you know whom to contact with questions or concerns. Tumor shape If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is well-defined, it is considered low risk. If the border isn’t well-defined and has an uneven shape, it is considered high risk. Tumor return after treatment Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned after treatment, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. All treatment types have a risk of recurrence. The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body. Any tumor that has returned after treatment is considered a high-risk squamous cell skin cancer. Tumor formed in damaged skin If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area that was previously treated with radiation therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer. This is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound, a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin. Nerve damage If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer. This is also called perineural invasion. Signs that the cancer may have invaded nerves include pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or movement, and double or blurred vision.

    "generated_answer": "Fair skin is a significant risk factor for developing Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal cell skin cancer. This increased risk is directly linked to the lower levels of melanin in lighter-colored skin.\n\n**The Role of Melanin**\nMelanin is the pigment produced by melanocytes in the skin. Its crucial function is to filter out the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, providing natural protection against UV-induced damage. People with fair skin have less melanin, which means they have less of this natural protective barrier.\n\n**Increased Risk of BCC**\nBecause fair skin offers less natural UV protection, individuals with this characteristic are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer, including BCC. The UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds can damage the DNA inside basal skin cells. When this DNA damage occurs, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control, leading to cancer. The combination of high UV exposure and lower melanin levels makes fair-skinned individuals particularly susceptible.\n\nThis risk factor is often grouped with other physical traits associated with lighter pigmentation, such as red or blond hair and light eye color, which together indicate a higher likelihood of developing BCC.\n\n### References\n\n* [1] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Basal Cell Skin Cancer\n* [2] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Basal Cell Skin Cancer\n* [3] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Basal Cell Skin Cancer",

Concrete examples across various cancers illustrate this diversity. For lung cancer, a primary risk factor is smoking tobacco. For skin cancers, risk factors include sun exposure for squamous cell skin cancer and other factors associated with basal cell skin cancer. For liver cancer, established risk factors include cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B. Other specific examples include having a reduced immune system for primary CNS lymphoma, and various factors associated with bladder, thyroid, and anal cancers.\\n\\nBeyond specific exposures, broader demographic and inherited elements are also significant risk factors. These include age, family history, genetic factors, and race. Furthermore, for certain diseases like squamous cell skin cancer, specific risk factors such as the lesion's location and size are used clinically to determine the disease's risk level.<SEP>A risk factor is something that increases the risk of developing a disease, such as cervical cancer.<SEP>A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting cancer, including prostate cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Ultraviolet (UV) Rays\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Ultraviolet (UV) rays are harmful rays from the sun that melanin helps protect the skin against.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Fair-Skinned People\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Fair-skinned people are identified as a group with a higher risk of developing squamous cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sunlight\", \"type\": \"naturalobject\", \"description\": \"Sunlight, particularly long-term exposure, is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer, especially for people who sunburn easily.<SEP>Sunlight, particularly long-term exposure, is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer, especially for people who sunburn easily.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Squamous Cell Skin Cancer\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Squamous cell skin cancer, also known as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), is the second most common type of skin cancer. It is highly treatable and often curable. This cancer typically begins as scaly patches on the skin and can develop from pre-cancerous lesions called actinic keratoses. It is most frequently caused by cumulative sun exposure over many years, with other major risk factors including indoor tanning and exposure to environmental toxins. It can also form within old wounds, burns, or scars.\\n\\nDiagnosis is confirmed through a skin biopsy. The disease is classified as local, regional, or metastatic, with the potential to spread to nearby lymph nodes. Treatment depends on the cancer's extent and risk classification. Primary treatments are surgical, including Mohs surgery and standard excision, often with lymph node assessment. Other options include radiation therapy and topical treatments. For advanced cases, systemic therapies such as chemotherapy, EGFR inhibitors, and PD-1 inhibitors are used.\\n\\nGiven its risk of recurrence and the increased risk of developing other skin cancers, patients require specific follow-up monitoring schedules after treatment, particularly for local and regional forms of the disease.<SEP>Squamous cell skin cancer is a type of cancer that can be treated with systemic therapy, including PD-1 inhibitors.<SEP>A type of skin cancer for which a weakened immune system is a risk factor, requiring regular screening and diagnosis via biopsy.<SEP>A type of skin cancer; recurrent tumors of this type are considered high-risk, and it can start in areas of damaged skin.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Melanocytes\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Melanocytes are specialized cells found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin.

Beyond its role in pigmentation, melanin serves a vital protective function by absorbing and scattering harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, thereby helping to shield the skin from UV-induced damage.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sunlight/Outdoor Tanning\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Sunlight and outdoor tanning are major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer, especially from long-term sun exposure over many years, particularly for people who sunburn easily or work outdoors.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"UV Light\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"UV light is radiation from the sun or tanning beds that increases the risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>UV light is radiation from the sun or tanning beds that increases the risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sun\", \"type\": \"naturalobject\", \"description\": \"The sun is a source of exposure that is commonly associated with the development of basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>The sun is a source of ultraviolet radiation; getting sunburns or spending too much time in the sun over many years is the most common cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>The sun is a source of exposure that is commonly associated with the development of basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>The sun is a source of ultraviolet radiation; getting sunburns or spending too much time in the sun over many years is the most common cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>The Sun is a source of UV light radiation that increases the risk of skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell skin cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Age\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Age is a fundamental and significant risk factor across multiple types of cancer, most prominently for prostate cancer. For prostate cancer, age is consistently identified as the leading or biggest risk factor, with the likelihood of developing the disease increasing substantially as one gets older. Diagnosis is most common in individuals aged 65 years and above. In clinical practice, a patient's age is a critical component used alongside Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test results, digital rectal exam findings, family history, and race to assess individual risk and to determine the need for further diagnostic procedures, such as a biopsy. Age also directly influences the interpretation of PSA levels in screening, with higher levels generally considered more suspicious for cancer in older individuals.\\n\\nBeyond prostate cancer, age is a recognized risk factor for other malignancies. The risk of bladder cancer increases as a person gets older. Similarly, for basal cell skin cancer, advancing age represents a key risk factor, largely due to the cumulative lifetime exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Furthermore, a patient's age is utilized by doctors as one factor in assessing the likelihood of hereditary ovarian cancer. Overall, age serves as a fundamental epidemiological and clinical variable in oncology, informing risk assessment and diagnostic pathways across multiple cancer types.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sun Exposure\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Long-term exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation, a primary cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Long-term exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation, a primary cause of squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Sun exposure over time is a cause of actinic keratosis and DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Ultraviolet Rays\", \"type\": \"naturalobject\", \"description\": \"Ultraviolet (UV) rays are harmful rays from the sun that can damage skin; melanin provides some protection against them.<SEP>Ultraviolet (UV) rays are harmful rays from the sun that can damage skin; melanin provides some protection against them.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"History Of Skin Cancer\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"A personal or family history of skin cancer increases the likelihood of developing any type of skin cancer, including basal cell.<SEP>A personal or family history of skin cancer increases the likelihood of developing any type of skin cancer, including basal cell.<SEP>A personal or family history of skin cancer increases the risk of developing any type of skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Basal Cell Carcinoma\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an alternative name for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, more common than squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an alternative name for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, more common than squamous cell skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an alternative name for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, mentioned as a point of comparison for squamous cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Prevention\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Prevention is important between follow-up exams to manage the risk of skin cancer.<SEP>Prevention refers to actions taken to stop a disease or condition from occurring.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Sunburns\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Sunburns are a common cause of squamous cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Light Eye Color\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Having a light eye color is a physical characteristic associated with a higher risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Having a light eye color is a physical characteristic associated with a higher risk of developing basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Light eye color is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer, associated with lighter skin pigmentation.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Immune Suppression\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Immune suppression, resulting from conditions like organ transplants or autoimmune diseases, increases the risk for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Immune suppression, resulting from conditions like organ transplants or autoimmune diseases, increases the risk for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>Immune suppression from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases increases the risk for basal cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Change In Skin Color\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"A mild change in skin color, either lightening or darkening, is a potential long-term side effect of radiation therapy.<SEP>A mild change in skin color, either lightening or darkening, is a potential long-term side effect of radiation therapy.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Red or Blond Hair\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.<SEP>A physical characteristic that is a risk factor for basal cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Melanoma\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer.

It uses high-energy radiation, such as x-rays or particles, to destroy cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The primary delivery methods are External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (internal radiation). It is a local therapy, typically administered in multiple sessions over several weeks, with the goal of delivering a high dose to a tumor while limiting exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.\\n\\nIts roles in cancer care are versatile. It can serve as a primary treatment, an adjuvant treatment after surgery to reduce recurrence risk, or a palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms. It is often utilized when surgery is not an option, when cancer remains after surgery, or if cancer recurs in a previously operated area. It is frequently combined with other therapies, such as concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation). Radiation therapy is a standard part of treatment for a wide spectrum of cancers, including but not limited to anal cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, thyroid cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and cancers of the bladder, cervix, breast, head and neck, prostate, rectum, and lung. Specifically, it is a main treatment for primary CNS lymphoma and a listed treatment for thyroid cancer, particularly for cases that cannot be surgically removed, do not take up radioactive iodine, and are progressing.\\n\\nA significant aspect involves managing side effects from damage to nearby healthy tissues. These include short-term effects like skin irritation and fatigue, and long-term risks such as organ damage. Specific risks include damage to reproductive organs causing infertility (noted in anal cancer treatment), vaginal stenosis from pelvic radiation, impacts on fertility, and the development of secondary cancers, especially if administered at a young age. Furthermore, if a squamous cell skin cancer later develops in an area that previously received radiation therapy, that cancer is considered high-risk.

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to help your tissues and organs show up more clearly in the picture. Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour. The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells. The radioactive part of the tracer lets your care team see how your cells are using the Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) A very common type of skin cancer Occurs more often in lighter-skinned people Is commonly found in areas of the body exposed to sun, especially the head and neck Rarely spreads to distant areas of the body Can spread in the area where it first forms If not treated can cause severe skin damage and even death Most people (over ) can be cured by completely removing the CSCC substance. This helps them find any usage that is not normal. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. Confirmed CSCC Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your doctor will follow up with: A complete head-to-toe skin exam to look for other lesions An exam of the lymph nodes Cancer cells can travel through blood and a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other parts of the body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease. If your lymph nodes feel larger than they should be, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes (this is also called “nodal disease”). To find out, your doctor will use a needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph node for testing.

People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun. Sun exposure Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over a long period of time, frequent tanning, and getting sunburns. Indoor tanning Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer. Using all types of indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds) increases the risk of getting any type of skin cancer. Environmental toxins People who are often exposed to pollutants such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be found in soil, water, and air) can experience skin damage that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns. This is known as Marjolin’s ulcer. CSCC that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come back after treatment. Actinic keratoses An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin caused by exposure to the sun over time that may become squamous cell skin cancer.

Superficial treatments Surgery Radiation therapy Systemic therapy Clinical trials Key points This chapter describes the types of treatment you may have for squamous cell skin cancer. The best treatment for you will depend on the extent of the cancer, whether surgery is a suitable option, and your personal preferences. Not everyone will receive the same treatment. Who is on my care team? After being diagnosed with squamous cell skin cancer, knowing what to do next can be confusing. Aside from your oncologist (your cancer doctor), there are others who may be involved in your cancer care. Some members of your care team will be with you throughout your treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and let them get to know you. Depending on your diagnosis, your care team might include the following: Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer. They also do skin exams and can teach you how to do them on your own. Mohs surgeons are doctors (usually dermatologists) who have advanced training in Mohs surgery and reconstruction after surgery. They remove the tumor, ensure no more cancer can be seen using a microscope, and can restore the appearance of the affected area with reconstructive surgery. Surgical oncologists are doctors who are trained to diagnose and surgically treat and remove cancerous tumors, including those that have spread beyond the skin. Medical oncologists are doctors who specialize in prescribing cancer-treatment drugs (chemotherapy). They are trained to diagnose and treat cancer using medicines that may be taken by mouth, be injected, or be given intravenously (through a vein). Pathologists are doctors who are trained to study tissue and cells removed during a biopsy under a microscope to determine the stage of a cancerous tumor. Plastic surgeons are doctors who can remove cancer as well as reconstruct, restore, and repair body parts. They may work with a pathologist at the time of your surgery for more immediate results. They are trained to close a wound after surgery, especially if it involves deeper tissue where general anesthesia may be needed.

Weakened immune system When your immune system is weakened, your body has trouble fighting off viruses, bacteria, and fungi. This can lead to infections and other health risks. Having a weakened immune system can put you at risk of squamous cell skin cancer. An example of when this happens is after organ transplantation. If you received an organ from another person, you likely take drugs to stop your body from attacking the donated organ. These drugs, called immunosuppressants, also reduce the body’s ability to fight infection and disease. The immune system also may not work well if you have other health conditions, such as: Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph nodes) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cancer of white blood cells in bone marrow) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS Any of these conditions can weaken the immune system, which can increase the risk of getting squamous cell skin cancer. Everyone with this condition should undergo skin cancer screening on a regular basis.

The liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts work together to make, store, and secrete bile. Bile is a fluid that helps digest fat in the food you eat. The liver also filters your blood and makes other important substances called factors that help your body function normally. This chapter will discuss the liver and give an overview of liver cancer. The liver The liver is a large organ located on the right side of the body under the rib cage. Inside the liver is a network of blood and lymph vessels. The liver filters blood, helps with blood clotting, makes bile, breaks down fats, and helps process sugar for energy. The liver also produces lymph. Lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs. The liver has two lobes, a right and left lobe. Blood enters the liver from the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Blood leaves the liver through the hepatic veins before entering the inferior vena cava and returning to the heart. The gallbladder is located near the right side of the liver and close to the first part of the small intestines (duodenum). The liver and nearby organs The gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, and small intestine are found near the liver. Bile Liver cells make bile. Bile is a yellow or green fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts such as potassium and sodium, water, and other elements found in the body. It flows into small channels that drain into thin tubes called ducts. These ducts form larger and larger channels that flow into the left and right hepatic ducts. The left and right hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct. The common hepatic duct joins with the cystic duct that connects to the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct is joined by the pancreatic duct just before it enters the small intestine.

This cancer is also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). This patient guide is about squamous cell skin cancer only. The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide. Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.

Checkpoint inhibitors recommended for use before colectomy in dMMR/MSI-H cancers include: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) Nivolumab (Opdivo) with or without ipilimumab (Yervoy) Sometimes radiation therapy (alone or with chemotherapy) is given along with systemic therapy for unresectable cancers. For more information on the side effects of checkpoint inhibitors, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Immunotherapy Side Effects: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Chemotherapy after surgery Chemotherapy is the use of medicine to kill cancer cells. It is a type of systemic therapy. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously. This means the medicine is slowly infused into the bloodstream through a vein. It travels through the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows your body to recover between cycles. Cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. Stage 1 Chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 1 cancers. Stage 2 Chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 2A and 2B dMMR/MSI-H cancers, but may be given for some stage 2C dMMR/MSI-H cancers. Chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for some stage 2 pMMR/MSS cancers. It is most helpful for cancers with a high risk of recurrence (returning after treatment). Your doctor will consider the features and risk factors of the cancer to determine if recurrence is likely. If chemotherapy is planned, recommended regimens include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin. These are given for 6 months. FOLFOX and CAPEOX are recommended options for high-risk cancers. FOLFOX is given for 6 months; CAPEOX for 3 months. Side effects Systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and healthy cells.

For skin cancers, risk factors include sun exposure for squamous cell skin cancer and other factors associated with basal cell skin cancer. For liver cancer, established risk factors include cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis B. Other specific examples include having a reduced immune system for primary CNS lymphoma, and various factors associated with bladder, thyroid, and anal cancers.\\n\\nBeyond specific exposures, broader demographic and inherited elements are also significant risk factors. These include age, family history, genetic factors, and race. Furthermore, for certain diseases like squamous cell skin cancer, specific risk factors such as the lesion's location and size are used clinically to determine the disease's risk level.<SEP>A risk factor is something that increases the risk of developing a disease, such as cervical cancer.<SEP>A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting cancer, including prostate cancer.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Aging\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Aging is a process or characteristic being described in relation to tumors found in specific anatomical locations.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Risk Factors\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Risk factors are characteristics, activities, environmental exposures, or inherited traits that increase a person's chance of developing a specific disease, such as cancer.

Common categories include lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking), environmental elements (e.g., chemical exposures), demographic traits (e.g., older age), personal health conditions, and family history or genetic predisposition. These factors vary significantly by cancer type. For instance, UV light exposure, fair skin, and light eye color are primary risk factors for basal cell skin cancer, while smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer. Similarly, specific lifestyle, chemical exposure, health conditions, and family history are associated with pancreatic cancer, and age and family history are key factors for prostate cancer.

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body.

Please wait to discuss the results with your doctor or health care team. Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment. Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support. These can be different people for different tasks or change over time. Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible, or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments. Write down questions and ask a friend or family member to take notes. Caregivers should ask questions, too. Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results.

Primary CNS lymphoma is often found when a person develops symptoms. A symptom is a feeling or problem that may be a sign of disease. Symptoms usually develop over several weeks. Primary CNS lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms. Symptoms are often related to the lymphoma’s location in the central nervous system. The most common location is in the central part of the brain. A lymphoma located here may cause specific nerve changes such as leg or arm weakness, or problems with coordination or movement. Other such symptoms may include changes in personality or behavior, depression, confusion, memory problems, loss of bladder control (incontinence), or difficulty speaking or swallowing. As the lymphoma tumor grows, it puts pressure on the CNS. This pressure often leads to neurological symptoms and difficulties, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. Changes in eyesight, such as blurry vision or double vision, can also occur. You’ll need several tests to confirm whether you have primary CNS lymphoma or a lymphoma that started in another part of your body, or a different disease with similar symptoms. Important tests include a neurological exam, imaging (MRI or CT scan), and biopsies. A biopsy means taking a sample of fluid or tissue from your body to look for cancer. You’ll also have blood tests, an eye exam, and other tests.

People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun. Sun exposure Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over a long period of time, frequent tanning, and getting sunburns. Indoor tanning Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer. Using all types of indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds) increases the risk of getting any type of skin cancer. Environmental toxins People who are often exposed to pollutants such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be found in soil, water, and air) can experience skin damage that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns. This is known as Marjolin’s ulcer. CSCC that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come back after treatment.

Chemotherapy Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. It is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden). Preoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given before surgery. It is also called neoadjuvant therapy. Postoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given after surgery. It is also called adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. More than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer. When only one drug is used, it’s called a single agent. A combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. Warnings about supplements and drug interactions You might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. Some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. This is called a drug interaction. It is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. Some examples include: Turmeric Gingko biloba Green tea extract St. John’s Wort Antioxidants Certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job.

The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide. Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.

Tumor shape If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is well-defined, it is considered low risk. If the border isn’t well-defined and has an uneven shape, it is considered high risk. Tumor return after treatment Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned after treatment, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. All treatment types have a risk of recurrence. The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body. Any tumor that has returned after treatment is considered a high-risk squamous cell skin cancer. Tumor formed in damaged skin If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area that was previously treated with radiation therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer. This is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound, a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin. Nerve damage If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer. This is also called perineural invasion. Signs that the cancer may have invaded nerves include pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or movement, and double or blurred vision.

Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year.

Some people are more likely than others to develop lung cancer. Anything that increases your chances of developing lung cancer is called a risk factor. Lung cancer screening is based on your risk factors described in this chapter. See your health care provider (HCP) regularly for checkups and cancer screenings, which may include screenings for skin, breast, prostate cancer, and other types of cancer.

Risk factors don’t necessarily cause a disease (and just because you have risk factors, it doesn’t mean you'll definitely get the disease). But people with primary CNS lymphoma often have one or more of these risk factors: Having an immunodeficiency disorder, which is an illness that weakens the immune system’s ability to fight infections and diseases. Primary CNS lymphoma is frequently linked to HIV, the immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Carrying the Epstein-Barr virus, which is the virus that causes mononucleosis (“mono”) and other illnesses. Epstein-Barr is one of the most common viruses in humans. Most people are infected with it. After you’re infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive or “sleeping”) in your body for life. Having an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, in which the immune system overreacts and attacks healthy tissues and organs. Having an organ transplant, which requires medications that suppress the immune system. This leads to a higher risk of infections. Being an older adult. Although primary CNS lymphoma can occur at any age, the majority of people diagnosed with it are in their 60s or 70s. How is primary CNS lymphoma diagnosed? Primary CNS lymphoma is often found when a person develops symptoms. A symptom is a feeling or problem that may be a sign of disease. Symptoms usually develop over several weeks. Primary CNS lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms. Symptoms are often related to the lymphoma’s location in the central nervous system. The most common location is in the central part of the brain. A lymphoma located here may cause specific nerve changes such as leg or arm weakness, or problems with coordination or movement. Other such symptoms may include changes in personality or behavior, depression, confusion, memory problems, loss of bladder control (incontinence), or difficulty speaking or swallowing. As the lymphoma tumor grows, it puts pressure on the CNS. This pressure often leads to neurological symptoms and difficulties, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. Changes in eyesight, such as blurry vision or double vision, can also occur. You’ll need several tests to confirm whether you have primary CNS lymphoma or a lymphoma that started in another part of your body, or a different disease with similar symptoms. Important tests include a neurological exam, imaging (MRI or CT scan), and biopsies. A biopsy means taking a sample of fluid or tissue from your body to look for cancer. You’ll also have blood tests, an eye exam, and other tests. If these tests\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"Treatment can affect fertility.

NCCN.org/patients/feedback 3 Mouth cancer staging How mouth cancer is staged TNM scores Mouth cancer stages Key points Cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. It describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. This chapter explains mouth cancer stages. How mouth cancer is staged A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have. This is called staging. Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. AJCC is just one type of staging system. Information gathered during staging: The extent (size) of the tumor (T): How large is the cancer? Has it grown into nearby areas? The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where? The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver? Biomarker testing: Does the cancer have any genes or mutations that might suggest treatment? Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. More information can be gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next. Staging includes: Anatomic – based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"’s natural defense against infection and disease. Having an impaired immune system may increase the risk of developing this cancer. Primary CNS lymphoma can spread to other areas within the nervous system. For example, it may spread from the brain to the eyes. But it rarely spreads to other areas of the body. However, a different kind of lymphoma—called secondary CNS lymphoma—starts in another part of the body but then spreads to the brain or spinal cord. This book is only about primary CNS lymphoma. What is the CNS? The central nervous system (CNS) receives signals from your senses, processes information, and controls your body’s responses. The CNS includes: The brain, which controls functions of the body such as feeling, moving, thinking, and learning. The eyes are connected directly to the brain and are also part of the CNS. h The spinal cord, which transmits messages between the brain and the body. Because the CNS is so important, your body has parts that protect it. These include: Meninges, which are membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid, which is a liquid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. h Bones including the skull that shields your brain and the vertebrae that surround your spinal cord. What causes primary CNS lymphoma? Every person diagnosed with cancer wants to know how they got it. Although no one knows exactly what causes a lymphoma, we do know that lymphomas often start with a genetic abnormality (mutation) in certain lymphocytes. This abnormality causes these lymphocytes to grow out of control (become cancerous). The abnormality occurs on its own. It’s not a mutation that occurs in other cells or organs in your body. And it’s not typically passed down in families (hereditary mutation). Although primary CNS lymphoma is rare, it could happen to almost anyone. However, some people with certain risk factors have a greater chance. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases your chance of developing a disease. For example, having a reduced immune system increases the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma. Risk factors don’t necessarily cause a disease (and just because you have risk factors, it doesn’t mean you'll definitely get the disease).

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

As lymph travels throughout your body, it passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes make immune cells that help the body fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and cancer cells. Lymphocytes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that helps fight and prevent infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood and lymph tissue, and every organ in the body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally grow in response to infection or inflammation. When they grow on their own without proper regulation, they can develop into lymphoma. Germinal centers Follicular lymphoma (FL) starts in the temporary germinal centers (GCs) of lymph nodes. These germinal centers are short-lived structures that form in response to infection or inflammation. When B cells within germinal centers grow out of control, it can form FL. There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies. An antibody is a protein that specifically targets infections or cancer cells and recruits other parts of the immune system. T lymphocytes or T cells help fight infections, cancer, and control immune responses. Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor cells or virus-infected cells. Follicular lymphoma starts in mature B cells. Follicular lymphoma Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is a slow-dividing, slow-growing B-cell lymphoma that typically forms tumors in lymph nodes. However, FL can form tumors in other parts of the body such as the bone marrow. This is called extranodal (outside of the lymph node) disease. Not everyone with FL needs treatment right away. How does FL develop? In lymph nodes, temporary germinal centers (GCs) form in response to an immune stressor such as infection or inflammation. This is normal. But, when cells within germinal centers grow without proper regulation, it can develop into FL. In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes group together to form clusters (follicles) in the lymph nodes. It might be helpful to know that these short-lived germinal centers are different than those found in some subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"approach is planned, chemotherapy is recommended for pMMR/MSS cancers.

It is a type of systemic therapy. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously. This means the medicine is slowly infused into the bloodstream through a vein. It travels through the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows your body to recover between cycles. Cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. Stage 1 Chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 1 cancers. Stage 2 Chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 2A and 2B dMMR/MSI-H cancers, but may be given for some stage 2C dMMR/MSI-H cancers. Chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for some stage 2 pMMR/MSS cancers. It is most helpful for cancers with a high risk of recurrence (returning after treatment). Your doctor will consider the features and risk factors of the cancer to determine if recurrence is likely. If chemotherapy is planned, recommended regimens include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin. These are given for 6 months. FOLFOX and CAPEOX are recommended options for high-risk cancers. FOLFOX is given for 6 months; CAPEOX for 3 months. Side effects Systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and healthy cells.

You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care. You may not know what to ask your care team. That’s common.

is based on the tumor location and cancer stage.Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of mouth cancer.It forms in the thin, flat cells of the mucous membranes of the mouth.SCC is the focus of this book.Mouth cancer Mouth or oral cancer can develop in the lips (mucosal lip), the lining inside the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa), the front two-thirds of the tongue, the upper and lower gums (gingiva), the floor of the mouth under the tongue, the bony roof of the mouth (hard palate), and the small area behind the wisdom teeth (retromolar trigone).2 Testing for mouth cancer Test

cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays.Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time.But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people.History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer.Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer.Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell

to 4 weeks after surgery to help prevent blood clots.If surgery first isn’t an option Having surgery first may not be an option.This could be due to the size or location of the tumor, other health conditions, or your overall health.In this case, chemotherapy is given first to shrink the cancer.You will need a biopsy to confirm that the tumor is ovarian cancer before starting chemotherapy.At this time, preferred regimens include: h Paclitaxel and carboplatin Paclitaxel, carboplatin, bevacizumab, and maintenance bevacizumab While the above regimens are preferred, there are other recommended options for chemotherapy.Your team will take into account any medical conditions and your overall health.These regimens may change as new information becomes available.After a few cycles of chemotherapy (2 to 3 months), your doctor will check to see how well chemotherapy worked and if surgery is an option.The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, as well as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus.Surgery performed after chemotherapy is called interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS).For stage 3 disease, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may

This aids in diagnosis and monitoring response to targeted therapies. Imaging tests In some cases, imaging tests may be performed. This is based on your individual situation. Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of the body to look for sites with leukemia outside the bone marrow. Leukemia can spread outside the bloodstream to lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. It rarely spreads to the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Imaging tests can also show areas of infection or bleeding that may impact your care.

You will likely not have all of the following tests. Contrast material Contrast material is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements. IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test. The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI. Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do. Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past.

More information on nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and throat (oropharyngeal) cancer can be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. It is strongly recommended, when possible, for those with head and neck cancers to be treated at a high-volume center or hospital that has experience in their type of cancer. Mouth cancer Cancer that occurs on the inside of the mouth is also called oral cancer or oral cavity cancer. Mouth cancer is one of several types of cancers grouped into a category called head and neck cancers. Mouth cancer and other head and neck cancers are often treated similarly. Mouth cancer starts in the squamous cells that form the surface lining of the mouth. Normally, these are thin, flat cells and are similar to the top layer of skin and surface lining some other parts of the body such as the lungs and esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of mouth cancer and is the focus of this book. Mouth cancer can develop in the parts that make up the mouth such as: Lips (mucosal lip) Gums (gingiva) Lining inside the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa) Front two-thirds of the tongue Roof of the mouth (hard palate) Bony, raised areas that hold the teeth sockets (alveolar ridge) h Floor of the mouth (under the tongue) Small area of the gum behind the wisdom teeth (retromolar trigone) Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip is not included in this book.

It is a diagnostic method that involves checking vital signs, such as height, weight, and other metrics, and systematically examining the body for signs of disease or abnormality. The exam typically includes a physical assessment of body systems—such as the lungs, heart, and abdomen—and a functional assessment of the patient's physical abilities. Common components involve feeling and listening to organs, performing a complete head and neck exam, and palpating for abnormalities like enlarged lymph nodes.\\n\\nThe physical exam serves multiple critical purposes across various medical specialties. It is a core component of the general diagnostic process and routine medical care. In specialized fields, it is adapted for specific contexts: an anesthesiologist performs an exam of the throat and airway as part of a pre-anesthesia assessment; a hematologist/oncologist checks lymph nodes, the spleen, and the liver; and it is part of short-term follow-up care after procedures like a total thyroidectomy. In oncology, the physical exam is particularly vital. It helps determine the initial clinical stage of cancers, functions as a surveillance method to check for recurrence, and is essential for treatment planning and monitoring during active therapies like chemotherapy, often performed every 1 to 3 cycles. It also plays a key role in long-term surveillance during routine follow-up visits after treatment.\\n\\nUltimately, the information gathered from the physical exam, combined with the patient's medical history, provides crucial data on the patient's overall health status, physical ability, and treatment progress, making it a cornerstone of comprehensive patient management.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC), also known as squamous cell skin cancer, is a very common type of skin cancer.

Their primary purposes are to assess a patient's general health, evaluate organ function (such as that of the liver and kidneys), check nutritional status, and detect signs of disease by measuring components like blood cells, proteins, hormones, and various chemicals. They are ordered when symptoms occur or a physical exam yields suspicious findings.\\n\\nIn oncology, blood tests are a fundamental part of the diagnostic, staging, treatment planning, and monitoring process for a wide array of cancers. This includes blood cancers like leukemias, lymphomas (such as cutaneous B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma), and solid tumors including colon, pancreatic, breast, ovarian, liver, stomach, kidney, adrenal, bone, and rectal cancers. For specific cancers, tests may detect unique markers; for example, tests for suspected ovarian cancer often include a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry profile, liver function tests, and tumor marker tests. Blood tests provide crucial information about a patient's baseline health and organ function before cancer treatment begins.\\n\\nBlood tests are seldom used alone for a definitive cancer diagnosis; their results are integrated with imaging studies and biopsies. They are ordered repeatedly to monitor a patient's response to therapies like chemotherapy, to check for cancer recurrence, and to optimize ongoing treatment.

It is a collaborative effort, typically involving a medical team that discusses findings with the patient, who is often advised to seek support during this period. The process generally begins after symptoms appear, as symptoms alone are frequently insufficient for a definitive identification.\\n\\nThe methodology is tailored to the suspected condition and employs a variety of tools, including physical examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, and surgical procedures such as biopsies. For solid tumors, like those in bladder, esophageal, liver, and kidney cancers, the process relies on a series of tests to confirm the disease's presence, location, and characteristics. Diagnosing a glioma or primary CNS lymphoma involves questions about symptom onset, physical exams, imaging, and often genetic testing or biopsy.\\n\\nFor hematologic cancers, diagnosis follows specific cellular criteria. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is diagnosed based on the presence of a certain percentage of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or blood, aided by molecular methods like RT-PCR. Similarly, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) requires that 20 percent or more of bone marrow cells are lymphoblasts. The process also applies to other conditions like squamous cell skin cancer. Following initial tests, results are discussed with the patient, and further testing may be required.

tested.This is called an excisional lymph node biopsy.While an excisional biopsy is preferred, a core needle biopsy may be done in some cases.In this method, a doctor uses a wide needle to remove a sample of tissue from a lymph node, but doesn’t remove the entire node.Guide 1 Testing for Hodgkin lymphoma\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"make detailed pictures of areas inside the body. For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to help your tissues and organs show up more clearly in the picture. Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour. The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells. The radioactive part of the tracer lets your care team see how your cells are using the Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) A very common type of skin cancer Occurs more often in lighter-skinned people Is commonly found in areas of the body exposed to sun, especially the head and neck Rarely spreads to distant areas of the body Can spread in the area where it first forms If not treated can cause severe skin damage and even death Most people (over ) can be cured by completely removing the CSCC substance. This helps them find any usage that is not normal. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. Confirmed CSCC Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your doctor will follow up with: A complete head-to-toe skin exam to look for other lesions An exam of the lymph nodes Cancer cells can travel through blood and a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other parts of the body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease. If your lymph nodes feel larger than they should be, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes (this is also called “nodal disease”). To find out, your doctor will use a needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph node for testing. Squamous cell\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"bolsters to help you keep still. Imaging To look for cancer that has spread beyond the bladder, you may have an imaging scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Because an MRI uses magnets, you can’t bring any metal objects (such as a cell phone, wristwatch, belt with a metal buckle, or jewelry) into the imaging room. Other types of imaging CT and MRI are commonly used to see how far bladder cancer has spread. Other types of imaging are sometimes used to look for cancer in other parts of the urinary tract or other parts of the body: Urogram uses a contrast solution and either CT or MRI to see how well your entire urinary tract is working. The contrast makes the lining of your kidneys, ureters, and bladder easier to see. You may have a urogram if you’re feeling symptoms such as pain in your side or back, or if you have blood in your urine. Renal ultrasound shows your kidneys, ureters, and bladder in real time. It’s the same technology used to look at a baby in the womb. A renal ultrasound is a painless, non-surgical test that produces black and white images of your kidneys and other organs. Pyelogram uses x-rays and contrast solution to look for a blockage—such as a tumor, kidney stone, or blood clot—in your ureters or kidneys. This test may also be used to find causes for blood in urine. A pyelogram is usually done in the operating room during a cystoscopy. You’ll be given anesthesia for this procedure. During the cystoscopy, the contrast is given intravenously (into a vein) or injected directly into the ureters.

Sometimes, a breast ultrasound or MRI is used to guide a biopsy. Biopsy A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of tissue or fluid. The sample is sent to a lab for testing. A pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. Ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment. There are different types of biopsies. Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI. The primary or main tumor is biopsied first. Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both. Types of possible biopsies include: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy (CB) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. In a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB), suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device. Incisional biopsy removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body. Excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area. This is not the preferred type of biopsy but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don’t match the expected findings. Skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast. Before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. A core needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. The samples are small. Biopsy In a biopsy, a sample of tumor is removed. There are different types of biopsy. This image shows an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. When mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy. One or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. The clips are small, painless, and made of metal. They will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. The clips will stay in place until surgery. If the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. The clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI. There are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies.

Diagnostic tests can help plan treatment after you’ve been diagnosed and can detect whether the cancer is still growing or spreading after treatment. Diagnostic tests include imaging scans, biopsies, and genetic tests. Imaging tests An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the insides of your body. The images can reveal cancer, including its size, location, and other features such as the size of the prostate itself. The images may show where the cancer started (primary tumor) and whether the cancer has spread (metastasized). After your scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in reading imaging tests. The radiologist will send the results to your care team. This information helps to plan the next steps of your care. Your team will discuss the results with you. Be sure to ask any questions you may have. Diagnosis vs. prognosis What’s the difference between your diagnosis and your prognosis? These two words sound alike but they’re very different. Diagnosis is identifying an illness based on tests. Your diagnosis names what illness you have. Prognosis is the likely course and outcome of a disease. Your prognosis predicts how your illness will turn out. Imaging can come before, during, or after a biopsy. Imaging may also be used after cancer treatment to see how well it worked and to check if the cancer comes back. Imaging methods for prostate cancer include MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, bone scan, or a combination of these. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. An MRI can be used to get a more detailed view of the cancer within the prostate. It’s also used to see if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the bones in your pelvis. MRI scans can also help to plan treatment, and may be used after treatment to check whether the cancer has come back (recurrence).

However, they may be done to find out what’s causing low blood cell counts. Biomarker tests CLL cells have unique features that can be used to plan treatment specifically for you. These features are called biomarkers. Biomarkers are found with lab tests using either a blood or bone marrow sample: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can show missing parts and extra copies of genetic material called chromosomes. It can detect a biomarker called 17p deletion. DNA sequencing is used to look for mutations in the TP53 and IGHV genes, which control how your cells die when they’re not healthy. A karyotype can show defects in chromosomes. A complex karyotype is 3 or more unrelated changes or deletions in more than one cell. Biomarkers used to select treatment are discussed in Chapter 4: Treatment for CLL. Diagnostic CT Computed tomography, or CT, is like an x-ray but it shows body tissue more clearly. A diagnostic CT uses more radiation than regular CT and adds a contrast agent. Some people refer to this as a CAT scan. A contrast agent is a chemical that highlights body tissues for the scanner. It’s given to you through a needle placed into a vein in your arm. Some people can’t have contrast due to certain health issues, like allergies or chronic kidney disease. Ask if contrast is safe for you. A diagnostic CT of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be needed for 2 reasons: To look for big lymph nodes that may be causing symptoms To assess the extent of the cancer before starting treatment Since a CT scan is often not needed, you should ask your doctor what the reason is to obtain the test. A CT scan is done in the radiology department, in a big machine that looks like a tunnel. The scan won’t hurt, but if you need contrast you will need to get a needle placed in your arm.

A CLL diagnosis requires at least 5,000 or more of the same white blood cells called monoclonal B lymphocytes to be found per microliter in your blood. Diagnosis by biopsy A biopsy is a procedure that removes samples from the body for testing. If the blood results aren’t clear, you’ll have a biopsy of your lymph nodes or bone marrow to confirm CLL. Tests of lymph nodes will also confirm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). An excisional biopsy is when a whole lymph node is removed by a surgeon, while an incisional biopsy removes only part of a lymph node. There are many lymph nodes throughout your body, so if you have a lymph node removed, you won’t lose your ability to fight infections and disease. Needle biopsies take a small sample of a lymph node using a needle. They can be done when other biopsies are not safe to perform.

Diagnostic tests If the PSA test, digital rectal exam, blood or urine tests, or other factors (like family history, race, or age) suggest you may have prostate cancer, you’ll be offered diagnostic testing. Talk with your doctor about whether a biopsy or imaging should be the next test you take. Imaging tests An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the insides of your body. The images can reveal cancer, including its size, location, and other features such as the size of the prostate itself. The images may show where the cancer started (primary tumor) and whether the cancer has spread (metastasized). Imaging is also used after cancer treatment to see how well it worked and to check if the cancer comes back. Imaging can come before, during, or after a biopsy. h Before – Imaging is sometimes ordered beforehand to find out if a biopsy is truly necessary. During – Imaging is used during a biopsy to guide the removal of tissue samples. After – Imaging may come after a biopsy to see the size and location of the cancer, which helps to plan treatment. Imaging methods for detecting prostate cancer include MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, bone scan, or a combination of these. After your scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist. A radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in reading imaging tests. The radiologist will send the results to your doctor. This information helps your doctor plan the next steps of your care. Your doctor will discuss the results with you. Be sure to ask any questions you may have. Imaging may not be needed for early-stage prostate cancer. If your PSA, digital rectal exam, and prostate biopsy results indicate that your risk is low for the cancer to metastasize (spread beyond the prostate), then you may not need imaging tests at this time. Your team may recommend one or more of the following imaging tests to look for cancer growth: MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. An MRI can provide a detailed view of the cancer within the prostate. It’s also used to see if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the bones in your pelvis. MRI may be used before a biopsy to target areas suspicious for cancer.

Everyone with this condition should undergo skin cancer screening on a regular basis. Diagnosis If you have an area of abnormal-looking skin (called a lesion) that looks like it could be skin cancer, the next step is testing. This will likely include: h A full health history A close examination of the lesion(s) A skin biopsy to remove a sample of the lesion and test it for cancer (this is the only way to know for sure if there’s cancer) Imaging scans if cancer may be deep within the skin or spread to other parts of the body Biopsy If a concerning lesion is found on your skin, some or all of it will be removed and sent to a lab to be looked at under a microscope. This is called a skin biopsy. A biopsy is needed to diagnose squamous cell skin cancer. Your sample should be reviewed by a pathologist. The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of your cells. There are several ways to do a skin biopsy. Your doctor will choose one based on the size of the affected area, where it is on your body, and other factors. Any biopsy is likely to leave at least a small scar. Different methods can result in different types of scars. Talk to your doctor about the type of biopsy and the risk of scarring before you have the biopsy. No matter which type of biopsy is done, it should remove as much of the suspected area as possible for an accurate diagnosis to be made. Skin biopsies are done using a local anesthetic (numbing medicine), which is injected into the area with a very small needle. You will likely feel a small prick and a little stinging as the medicine is injected, but you should not feel any pain during the biopsy. Skin shave biopsy A skin shave biopsy can be done on the skin surface (superficial) or deeper. Superficial shave biopsies are useful for very flat skin lesions. This type of biopsy removes the top layer of skin (epidermis) and part of the dermis using a tool similar to a razor. Skin punch biopsy During a skin punch biopsy, a small piece of skin and connective tissue are removed using a hand-held tool. Stitches are often used to close the opening in the skin.

It serves as a primary treatment method for many cancers, fulfilling both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Therapeutically, it aims to completely remove cancer, slow its growth, or alleviate symptoms. Diagnostically, examining removed tissue provides a definitive diagnosis and determines the cancer's exact extent, type, and stage.\\n\\nSurgery is a common and often main treatment for numerous specific cancers. These include basal and squamous cell skin cancers, thyroid cancer, early-stage cervical cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, rectal cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, gliomas, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. It is also used for conditions like chondrosarcoma and chordoma, and is the preferred treatment for cancer that recurs in the neck if it can be removed based on size and location. For some cancers, such as ovarian cancer, testing is required to determine if surgery is possible, and it may not always be the first available option.\\n\\nThe procedure is frequently integrated into a multimodal treatment approach. A treatment team may assess it as a main goal, and it is often combined with systemic therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation given before or after. However, surgery is not suitable for all cases. Its feasibility depends on tumor characteristics, location, and patient health. It may not be suitable for some metastatic cancers and is normally not recommended for treating primary CNS lymphoma. Surgery carries inherent risks and common side effects including pain, swelling, and scars, and can lead to complications like vaginal stenosis.

It is a local therapy, typically administered in multiple sessions over several weeks, with the goal of delivering a high dose to a tumor while limiting exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.\\n\\nIts roles in cancer care are versatile. It can serve as a primary treatment, an adjuvant treatment after surgery to reduce recurrence risk, or a palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms. It is often utilized when surgery is not an option, when cancer remains after surgery, or if cancer recurs in a previously operated area. It is frequently combined with other therapies, such as concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation). Radiation therapy is a standard part of treatment for a wide spectrum of cancers, including but not limited to anal cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, thyroid cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and cancers of the bladder, cervix, breast, head and neck, prostate, rectum, and lung.

This regimen may include radiation therapy alone or in combination with systemic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy).\\n\\nThe sequence can also be reversed, with radiation therapy given *before* surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) to shrink a tumor, though this is less commonly stated in the provided descriptions. Furthermore, radiation therapy can be employed as a standalone treatment instead of surgery. This is applicable in specific scenarios, such as when a patient is medically unfit for surgery, or when the cancer (e.g., certain thyroid cancers) is located in an area where surgical removal is not feasible.\\n\\nConversely, surgery can also follow prior radiation treatment. In cases where a cancer, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), recurs or grows in an area previously treated with radiation, surgery becomes the preferred option because re-treatment of the same area with radiation is generally not advised due to toxicity concerns. Thus, the relationship is dynamic, with the order and choice of treatment determined by cancer type, location, patient health, and prior treatments.<SEP>Radiation therapy is often given after surgery

Observation may be an option for a stage 1A or 1B, low-grade tumor. Ask your doctor if this applies to your cancer.

Six cycles of chemotherapy are recommended for high-grade serous tumors. Between 3 and 6 cycles are recommended for all other stage 1 tumors. The specific number of cycles needed depends on the tumor type and other factors. Stages 2, 3, and 4 For common tumor types, chemotherapy is recommended after surgery for all newly diagnosed stage 2, 3, and 4 ovarian cancers. At this time, the preferred chemotherapy regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given every 3 weeks. Six cycles are given for stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers. If you can't have this regimen, there are other recommended options. A drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) may be added to your chemotherapy. It stops the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumor. If chemotherapy works well, the next step may include maintenance therapy. See page 31 for more information. How chemotherapy is given Most chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is given intravenously. This means the medicine is put directly into your bloodstream through a vein. You may get a port to receive chemotherapy. This is a small, round disc that is usually placed under your skin in the upper chest. It is inserted during a minor surgery and stays in the body until treatment is complete. After treatment the port can be easily removed. Once the port is removed, the skin will heal. Chemotherapy medicine can also be slowly injected into the abdomen. This is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. When given this way, higher doses of the drugs are delivered directly to the cancer cells in the belly area. IP chemotherapy is given through a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is usually connected to a port placed inside the abdomen during surgery. Monitoring during chemotherapy Your doctor will monitor how well the chemotherapy is working and assess for side effects. Expect to have a physical exam every 1 to 3 cycles. A pelvic and rectovaginal exam may be done at the same time. Imaging and blood tests are ordered as needed. Testing for CA-125 or other tumor markers may be performed before each cycle of chemotherapy.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer has grown through the bladder’s inner urothelial layer and into its muscle layer. But it hasn’t grown anywhere else. Metastatic bladder cancer has spread outside the bladder to other areas of the body. Common areas of metastatic bladder cancer include the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, and the inner wall of the abdomen. (Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands that transport a fluid called lymph and help fight infection. Lymph nodes are found around the urinary tract and all over the body.) Treatment is different for each of these three phases of bladder cancer. These phases are further divided into stages, which are explained in Chapter Bladder cancer treatment What’s the best treatment for bladder cancer? There’s no single treatment that’s best for everyone. The best treatment for bladder cancer is the treatment that’s best for you. You’ll work with your treatment team to choose which option makes the most sense for you. This choice is based on your cancer stage as well as your overall health and personal preferences. Very often, the best option includes more than one type of therapy. Common treatments for bladder cancer include: Surgery Chemotherapy Immunotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Surgery, by itself or with other treatments, can be used in many stages of bladder cancer. For less advanced cancer, a minor surgical procedure can be used to remove just the tumor. For more advanced cancer, the entire bladder can be surgically removed. In addition, you may receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy directly into the bladder. For people with metastatic bladder cancer, chemotherapy or immunotherapy is used to treat cancer anywhere in the body. Another treatment option is to join a clinical trial. You’ll also receive treatment for any side effects caused by cancer therapy. Can bladder cancer be cured? Bladder cancer in an early (non-invasive) stage can usually be cured. Treatment for more advanced stage (muscle-invasive) bladder cancer can be complicated but it may still get rid of the cancer. Metastatic bladder cancer is not typically curable, but it is still treatable. And treatments are improving all the time. For most people with bladder cancer, treatment provides a longer and more comfortable life with fewer symptoms. It’s important to know that bladder cancer commonly comes back even after treatment.

Samples of cervical tissue are removed and tested for dysplasia and cancer. A cone biopsy may be used to gather more information after a cervical biopsy or to treat early cervical cancer. It involves removing a cone-shaped portion of the cervix. Blood tests provide helpful information about your general health and the health of your liver, kidneys, and other organs before treatment. Imaging helps determine the extent of the cancer before treatment. Initial imaging may include CT, MRI, PET, and/or transvaginal ultrasound. h A cystoscopy and/or proctoscopy under anesthesia may be needed to look for signs of cancer in the bladder and bowel. Fertility-sparing treatment may be an option for cancer that is only in the cervix. The stage is a rating of the extent of the cancer before any treatment is given. It is used to determine your treatment options. The FIGO system is used to stage cervical cancer. Quitting smoking can lead to better cancer treatment outcomes.

The types of surgery that may be used are described below. Removing only a portion of the cervix may be an option for the earliest stage of cervical cancer. In most cases, however, the entire cervix must be removed. While this can sometimes be performed through the vagina, an abdominal incision (cut) is usually needed. When the surgery is performed through a traditional (big) incision through the abdomen, the approach is known as laparotomy.

Most are curable with the right treatment. When possible, surgery is recommended for most thyroid cancers. The thyroid The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck. It has 2 lobes, a right and a left. A thin piece of tissue called the isthmus connects the lobes. The thyroid makes hormones. These substances are essential for the body to function properly. They circulate in the blood and help regulate body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and metabolism (how fast food becomes fuel for your body). The two main hormones made by the thyroid are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Together, these are often referred to simply as “thyroid hormone.” The thyroid uses a mineral from your diet called iodine to produce these hormones. Certain foods and iodized salt contain iodine. There are four pea-sized glands on the back of the thyroid gland. These parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in your bloodstream. Thyroid gland The thyroid is a butterflyshaped gland in the lower front part of the neck. It makes hormones that control blood pressure, metabolism, and other body functions. Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are small, often round areas of abnormal growth within the thyroid gland. Most are not cancerous. Very small nodules usually can't be seen or felt. Your provider may be able to see or feel a large nodule while examining your lower neck. Most thyroid nodules don't cause symptoms. They are often found by imaging tests done for a different reason. Symptoms of a larger nodule could include: A visible lump in the neck Neck pain Voice changes Trouble breathing Problems swallowing Who is at risk?

This may be done the same day or a few days after a PDEMA/Mohs procedure or standard surgical excision. After surgery, your skin will continue healing for a period of between 6 to 10 weeks. Scar treatment and aftercare for the skin around the wound will likely be recommended. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (RT) is a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy – from electrons (beams), photons (high-energy x-rays), or protons (charged particles) -- to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy usually involves 5 daily brief treatments per week over 3 to 7 weeks. Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist (a doctor who is an expert in radiation treatment). Types of radiation therapy There are two general types of radiation therapy that can be used to treat CSCC: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. In EBRT, a beam of radiation is directed at the tumor from a machine. The two most common types of external beam radiation for CSCC are electrons and photons. Electrons are used to treat superficial tumors. Photons are used to treat deeper, more invasive tumors. In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed close to or in direct contact with the tumor for a short period of time. Uses for radiation therapy Radiation therapy is an option for people after resection (surgery) of their cancer, or for those who cannot or choose not to have surgery. However, radiation therapy can be very effective for small tumors, and for tumors in areas such as the head and neck. Radiation therapy should not be used in people who have certain genetic conditions that put them at higher risk of skin cancer caused by radiation, such as basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum. It may also not be appropriate for some people who have connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma. The same area generally should not be treated with radiation more than once. When CSCC grows in a radiated area, it usually needs to be removed with surgery. However, the area often doesn’t heal as well because the tissues were weakened by the radiation. This is especially true for CSCC on the scalp. A radiation oncologist should help you determine whether this treatment is appropriate for you. Adjuvant therapy refers to therapy that is given after primary treatment to lower the risk that cancer will come\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"the course of treatment. Many doctors wait and order it only if the cancer returns or spreads. Testing should be performed on tumor tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery when possible. Otherwise, a sample of blood may be tested instead. Other names for this testing include molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic testing, tumor gene testing, nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), mutation testing, and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Testing for PD-L1 expression is recommended for everyone with recurrent, progressive, or metastatic cervical cancer. If the PD-L1 level exceeds a set cutoff point, the cancer is considered PD-L1-positive. If needed, treatment with certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies may be an option for PD-L1–positive tumors. The biomarkers listed below are less common in cervical cancer but should still be tested for. Mismatch repair (MMR) Microsatellite instability (MSI) Tumor mutational burden (TMB) NTRK gene fusion (for those with a cervical sarcoma) HER2 RET gene fusion If cancer returns to the pelvis Cervical cancer that returns to the pelvis only is known as a local or regional recurrence. If the area has not been treated with radiation and the cancer can be surgically removed, this is generally preferred. After surgery, EBRT and systemic therapy are recommended. Brachytherapy may also be given. If the area has already been treated with radiation and it is no longer an option, possible treatment options are listed below. The best option(s) for you will depend on the specific location of the new cancer growth in the pelvis. Pelvic exenteration surgery Radical hysterectomy Brachytherapy Individualized EBRT and possibly systemic therapy Systemic therapy Resection of new cancer growth Radical hysterectomy and brachytherapy are typically only considered in carefully selected patients. Supportive care is always an option, whether you are in active treatment or not. Pelvic exenteration Pelvic exenteration is a radical surgery that involves removing multiple organs from the pelvis. The goal is to cure the cancer by removing all of the organs to which cancer has or may spread. All remaining organs of the female reproductive system are removed during pelvic exenteration. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and vagina. Nearby organs in the pelvis including the bladder, rectum, and/or anus may also be removed. If the bladder and/or organs involved in bowel function are removed, a diversion is typically performed. Diversions are surgical procedures that divert (redirect) urine and\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"recommended. If you can have it, radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is recommended. Platinumbased chemotherapy is a recommended option for use with radiation. If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may damage healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial may also be an option. A clinical trial could involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy.  See Part 6: When treatment is over for information on monitoring and follow-up care. Metastatic squamous cell skin cancer Cancer cells can spread through blood and lymph to form tumors in other areas of the body. This is called metastasis. Squamous cell skin cancer does not metastasize often. For this reason, there is not much research on the best way to treat metastatic squamous cell skin cancer. A discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended to consider your treatment options. If surgery and/or radiation therapy cannot remove metastatic CSCC, systemic therapy is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial for systemic therapy is another option. A clinical trial could involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Help for symptoms Radiation therapy and/or surgery may be used to treat distant tumors that are causing pain or other bothersome side effects. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a special radiation technique that may be used in some cases. It sends high doses of radiation to small areas to kill cancer cells and is typically given over 3 to 5 treatments. Key points Squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes is called “regional”. Your care team will test suspicious lymph nodes to determine how far the disease has spread. Testing could also include scans of your upper body, stomach, and pelvis to check for any metastatic disease (spread) to those areas. The best way to treat regional CSCC is with surgery to remove the tumor and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is often given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells. If surgery is not possible or not recommended, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or a combination of both may be options\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"are treated with radiation therapy, which is explained in Chapter Other cancers are treated with 2 types of treatments called chemoradiation.

Cancers that spread to the lungs are not lung cancer. Early and locally advanced NSCLCs are cancers that have grown from the airways into lung tissue, and some have spread to lymph nodes. Treatment for NSCLC varies based on what is best for each person. When possible, surgery is used for primary treatment. 2 Lung nodules Lung nodule experts Risk for lung cancer Signs of lung cancer Planning follow-up care Types of follow-up care Follow-up of solid nodules Follow-up of subsolid nodules Planning to remove tissue Removing samples for cancer testing Confirming lung cancer Key points Many people have small masses of tissue in their lungs, called nodules. A nodule may have been found in your lung by chance. This chapter discusses how experts decide if this nodule is cancer. Lung nodule experts Most lung nodules are not cancer, but some are. Nodules can be caused by cancer, infections, scar tissue, and other health conditions. When a nodule found by chance seems to be cancer, it takes a team of experts to decide the best course of care.

It uses high-energy radiation, such as x-rays or particles, to destroy cancer cells by damaging their DNA. The primary delivery methods are External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy (internal radiation). It is a local therapy, typically administered in multiple sessions over several weeks, with the goal of delivering a high dose to a tumor while limiting exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.\\n\\nIts roles in cancer care are versatile. It can serve as a primary treatment, an adjuvant treatment after surgery to reduce recurrence risk, or a palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms. It is often utilized when surgery is not an option, when cancer remains after surgery, or if cancer recurs in a previously operated area. It is frequently combined with other therapies, such as concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation). Radiation therapy is a standard part of treatment for a wide spectrum of cancers, including but not limited to anal cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, thyroid cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and cancers of the bladder, cervix, breast, head and neck, prostate, rectum, and lung. Specifically, it is a main treatment for primary CNS lymphoma and a listed treatment for thyroid cancer, particularly for cases that cannot be surgically removed, do not take up radioactive iodine, and are progressing.\\n\\nA significant aspect involves managing side effects from damage to nearby healthy tissues. These include short-term effects like skin irritation and fatigue, and long-term risks such as organ damage. Specific risks include damage to reproductive organs causing infertility (noted in anal cancer treatment), vaginal stenosis from pelvic radiation, impacts on fertility, and the development of secondary cancers, especially if administered at a young age. Furthermore, if a squamous cell skin cancer later develops in an area that previously received radiation therapy, that cancer is considered high-risk. Radiation therapy also generally cannot be reused on the same area if cancer recurs.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Treatment\", \"type\": \"method\", \"description\": \"Treatment is a medical intervention or course of care provided to a patient to manage, cure, or address a disease, injury, or health condition. It is determined to be the best course of action based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's medical history, diagnostic test results, and the specific characteristics of their condition. The primary goals are to manage disease, achieve remission, slow progression, reduce symptoms, and improve both the length and quality of a patient's life. Its details, including a specific start date, are recorded in the medical record and shared with the care team, and it is a phase during which having a support system is beneficial.\\n\\nTreatment modalities are diverse and chosen through patient-doctor discussion, and they can be started when the care team deems it necessary. They include surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies like chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The approach is highly specific and depends on the type of condition. For cancers, the assessment incorporates factors like stage, grade, and genetic mutations. For example, treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) may involve pills or intravenous infusions, while active surveillance might be used for low-risk prostate cancer. For prostate cancer, treatment is a method used to slow down advanced disease, reduce symptoms, and help people live longer, though determining the best option is a key question. For Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), treatment depends on the type of ALL, age at diagnosis, and other factors.

Their hallmark behaviors include uncontrollable multiplication, evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and the ability to crowd out and damage normal cells, leading to symptoms and the formation of primary tumors. A key danger is their capacity for invasion and metastasis; they can break away from the primary tumor, invade surrounding tissues, and travel through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to establish secondary tumors in distant organs. This potential for spread, particularly through the lymphatic system, often prompts procedures like lymph node dissection during surgery for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.\\n\\nThese cells exhibit distinct biological, metabolic, and physical properties. They are characterized by specific DNA mutations, altered protein expression, and other biomarkers, which pathologists study by analyzing tumor samples, biopsies, lymph nodes, and tissue margins. This laboratory analysis is critical for diagnosing specific cancers (such as glioma), determining the cancer grade by comparison to normal cells, and assessing risk. A defining metabolic trait is their accelerated rate of glucose consumption, which fuels their rapid division. This high metabolic activity is exploited in medical imaging; during a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, cancer cells take up a radioactive sugar tracer and often appear as bright spots due to their faster sugar use, though not all such bright spots are cancerous.\\n\\nConsequently, cancer cells are the fundamental target of all cancer therapies.

Additionally, a rare condition known as Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN) can manifest in the skin.\\n\\nThe skin is affected by cancer treatments. During radiation therapy, it is an area near a tumor that clinicians aim to limit exposure to, using techniques like Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) to minimize side effects such as hardening, discoloration, spider veins, or ulcers. The skin also serves as a site for therapeutic devices; a chemotherapy port is surgically placed under it, and the skin heals after the port's removal. Furthermore, the skin can be a site of metastatic spread from other cancers.\"}\n```\n\nKnowledge Graph Data (Relationship):\n\n```json\n{\"entity1\": \"Care Team\", \"entity2\": \"Radiation Therapy\", \"description\": \"A patient's care team advises on which radiation options are best and what side effects to expect.\"}\n{\"entity1\": \"Basal Cell Skin Cancer\", \"entity2\": \"Radiation Therapy Treatment\", \"description\": \"Radiation therapy might be used to treat basal cell skin cancer.\"}\n{\"entity1\": \"Chemotherapy\", \"entity2\": \"Radiation Therapy\", \"description\": \"The relation between **chemotherapy and radiation therapy** is primarily one of combined clinical application in oncology, with comparative considerations regarding side effects. These two modalities are frequently used together in a synergistic treatment approach known as chemoradiation or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. This combination is standard for several cancers, including anal and bladder cancer, where it has been shown to be more effective than either chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone. For metastatic anal cancer and other metastatic cancers, the addition of radiation therapy to chemotherapy is a documented treatment option.\\n\\nA key point of comparison between the two treatments involves their risk profiles. Specifically, radiation therapy is noted to pose a potentially higher risk of causing damage to the nervous system compared to chemotherapy. In clinical practice, radiation therapy can be administered either with or without chemotherapy, and the decision is based on the specific cancer type, stage, and treatment goals.

The two modalities are frequently combined, with radiation therapy most often administered *after* surgery. This post-operative (adjuvant) application aims to eliminate any microscopic remaining cancer cells, thereby decreasing the chance of the tumor returning or recurring. This regimen may include radiation therapy alone or in combination with systemic therapy (e.g., chemotherapy).\\n\\nThe sequence can also be reversed, with radiation therapy given *before* surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) to shrink a tumor, though this is less commonly stated in the provided descriptions. Furthermore, radiation therapy can be employed as a standalone treatment instead of surgery. This is applicable in specific scenarios, such as when a patient is medically unfit for surgery, or when the cancer (e.g., certain thyroid cancers) is located in an area where surgical removal is not feasible.\\n\\nConversely, surgery can also follow prior radiation treatment. In cases where a cancer, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), recurs or grows in an area previously treated with radiation, surgery becomes the preferred option because re-treatment of the same area with radiation is generally not advised due to toxicity concerns.

Scar treatment and aftercare for the skin around the wound will likely be recommended. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (RT) is a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy – from electrons (beams), photons (high-energy x-rays), or protons (charged particles) -- to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy usually involves 5 daily brief treatments per week over 3 to 7 weeks. Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist (a doctor who is an expert in radiation treatment). Types of radiation therapy There are two general types of radiation therapy that can be used to treat CSCC: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. In EBRT, a beam of radiation is directed at the tumor from a machine. The two most common types of external beam radiation for CSCC are electrons and photons. Electrons are used to treat superficial tumors. Photons are used to treat deeper, more invasive tumors.

The most commonly used radiation technique for primary CNS lymphoma is treatment of the entire brain, called whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Because primary CNS lymphoma can occur in multiple spots anywhere in the brain, WBRT is used to treat the entire brain all at once.

Geneticists are doctors who study how traits are passed down from parents to children through genes. They are trained to diagnose and treat genetic disorders and counsel people and families at risk. Oncology nurses are nurses who provide hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects. Sometimes, these experts are called nurse navigators. You know your body better than anyone. Help other team members understand: How you feel What you need h What is working and what is not Your goals for treatment Keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. This will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know whom to contact with questions or concerns. Superficial treatments Treatments that affect only the top layer of the skin are called superficial treatments. They may be used to treat the earliest form of squamous cell skin cancer, called Bowen’s disease. They are also used for actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions) that are in the same general area as the Bowen’s lesion. Photodynamic therapy In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a lightsensitive drug is applied to the area. When exposed to light (either red or blue light in the doctor’s office, or shaded outdoor light), the drug becomes active and kills cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy A drug applied to the skin becomes active and kills cancer cells when exposed to light. Common side effects of PDT include itching or burning when the liquid is applied, pain during the red or blue light exposure, and itching and redness for a few days after treatment. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy (also called cryosurgery) freezes and destroys precancerous and cancerous cells using a very cold liquid or tool. Liquid nitrogen is often used. Cryotherapy sometimes causes a burning sensation during treatment. A blister and scab will form, which heals over 2 to 3 weeks.

Most centers currently use HDR brachytherapy. Treatment is typically given in 3 to 5 sessions over 2 weeks. If you have not had a hysterectomy, a device called an applicator is inserted into the uterus through the vagina. A “tandem and ring” applicator is commonly used for HDR brachytherapy. The tandem is a long, thin tube that extends into the uterus. The ring is a hollow circle that stays in the vagina, pressed against the cervix. A tandem and ovoid applicator uses hollow, rounded capsules instead of a ring. General anesthesia or deep sedation is often required, especially for the first applicator placement. The applicator is placed to align with the tissue targeted for treatment. Often, an imaging technique (MRI or CT) is used to guide placement of the applicator. These images are used to design the brachytherapy treatment plan. The applicator is connected to a brachytherapy machine. A radiation source travels from the machine through the hollow tubes and into the applicator. Treatment takes about 10 minutes. Sometimes brachytherapy is given as treatments over a couple days. In this case, the instruments are placed and left in the body until all the treatments have been given (1 to 2 days). You will need to remain in bed until treatment is complete so that the instruments don’t move. Brachytherapy is typically started in the final week or right after completing EBRT. Shrinking the tumor with EBRT first allows for better placement of the brachytherapy applicators. Treatment with both types of radiation therapy can be completed within 7 to 8 weeks. Side effects The side effects of brachytherapy are similar to those of EBRT and include: h Skin irritation near treatment area Tiredness (fatigue) Soreness in your pelvic area Difficulty urinating or painful urination Softer bowel movements or diarrhea Increased vaginal discharge Systemic therapy Systemic therapy is treatment with substances that travel in the bloodstream, reaching cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are types of systemic therapy. Most systemic therapies are given intravenously. This means they are slowly infused into your bloodstream through a vein. Infusions are often given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows your body to recover between cycles. Chemotherapy Platinum-based chemotherapy is the most commonly used systemic therapy for cervical cancer.

It is a potential outcome for this type of skin cancer.\n\nHere are the key details based on the provided context:\n\n*   **Definition:** Recurrence is the return of cancer after a period of being cancer-free following treatment. For basal cell skin cancer (also known as BCC), this means the cancer may come back to the same location as the original tumor or appear in another part of the body [Knowledge Graph].\n*   **Risk Classification:** In the specific context of squamous cell skin cancer, a tumor that returns after treatment is automatically considered a **high-risk** cancer. While this point is made about squamous cell carcinoma, it illustrates the clinical significance of recurrence in skin cancers [Document Chunk].\n*   **Part of Broader Care:** Monitoring for recurrence is a central component of **survivorship** care, which begins after primary treatment ends. This involves keeping alert for any new symptoms and attending regular follow-up appointments [Knowledge Graph].\n*   **Management:** If a recurrence is suspected based on symptoms or exam findings, further diagnostic steps like imaging tests (e.g., CT, PET, MRI) are typically ordered to confirm and assess the extent of the cancer [Document Chunk].\n\nIn summary, for a patient with BCC, recurrence is the event of the cancer coming back after treatment. It is a key concern during long-term follow-up care, and its detection influences subsequent treatment decisions.\n\n### References\n\n* [1] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Cervical Cancer\n* [2] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Squamous Cell Skin Cancer\n* [3] NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Ovarian Cancer",

It is a potential outcome that doctors assess based on specific cancer features and patient risk factors. The nature and location of a recurrence vary significantly by cancer type. It can manifest as a local return at the original site, a regional return in nearby areas, or a distant metastasis to lymph nodes or other body parts. For example, basal cell skin cancer may return locally or metastasize, thyroid cancer can recur in the neck or distant areas, and many cancers can spread to distant organs.\\n\\nDetection relies on surveillance methods during the post-treatment period, with imaging such as MRI being a common tool. Specific techniques like PSMA/PET imaging are employed for monitoring cancers like prostate cancer. A recurrence may also be indicated by the emergence of specific symptoms. The clinical management of recurrence is a critical element in cancer care, directly impacting prognosis and subsequent treatment decisions. Treatment is highly dependent on the location and type of the recurrent cancer and may include strategies like targeted therapy and immunotherapy for cervical cancer, adjuvant intravesical BCG for bladder cancer to lower the risk, or distinct considerations in rectal cancer management.

Inherited germline mutations in genes like BRCA1, BRCA2, and those associated with Lynch syndrome significantly increase risk, and a family history of the disease is also a key risk factor. Consequently, genetic testing and tumor testing for BRCA and other DNA repair gene mutations are now recommended for every diagnosis.\\n\\nThe disease is diagnosed and evaluated through various medical procedures. Diagnostic methods include imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, PET scans, and chest x-rays. Definitive tissue diagnosis is achieved via procedures like laparoscopy and biopsy. Tumor markers, most notably CA-125, are utilized for both diagnosis and monitoring. The progression is staged using the FIGO system (Stages I through IV with substages), which directly impacts patient outcomes.\\n\\nTreatment typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Surgical methods include laparotomy, laparoscopy, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and surgical staging.

A very high-risk CSCC has an increased risk of local recurrence and of metastasis (spread). The risk level or category for skin cancer is usually based on the highest risk factor found. The following factors are used to determine your risk level. Location and size Squamous cell skin cancer on the head or neck is more likely to return after treatment than tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs. The following tumors are considered high risk because of their location and/or size: Tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs that are between 2 centimeters (cm) (about the size of a nickel) and 4 cm (about the size of a quarter) Any size tumor on the head, face, neck, hands, feet, shins, or sex organs The following tumors are considered very high risk because of their size: h Any tumor over 4 cm in any location Get to know your care team Keep the names and contact information for each member of your care team on hand, so you know whom to contact with questions or concerns. Tumor shape If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is well-defined, it is considered low risk. If the border isn’t well-defined and has an uneven shape, it is considered high risk. Tumor return after treatment Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned after treatment, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. All treatment types have a risk of recurrence. The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body. Any tumor that has returned after treatment is considered a high-risk squamous cell skin cancer. Tumor formed in damaged skin If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area that was previously treated with radiation therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer. This is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound, a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin. Nerve damage If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer. This is also called perineural invasion. Signs that the cancer may have invaded nerves include pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or movement, and double or blurred vision.

Or the results may suggest that the cancer will grow very slowly and not spread outside of the prostate at all. This information helps plan the best treatment for your type of cancer. By looking at your biopsy samples, the pathologist will identify certain cancer cell patterns (called Gleason patterns), which are used to calculate your Gleason score, which translates to your Grade Group, which estimates your risk. This can be confusing at first (Gleason patterns? Gleason score? Grade Group?) but it’s not all that complicated in the end. Read on.

Metastatic cancer For stage 4B or distant recurrences of cervical cancer, imaging is used mainly to learn how the cancer is responding to systemic therapy. Imaging may include CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT. Pap tests Depending on the type of surgery you have (if any), you may have annual Pap screening tests after treatment. Pap testing is helpful for finding new areas of abnormal and/or precancerous cells. It is not as good at detecting recurrent cervical cancer. Pap testing is also known as cervical or vaginal cytology. Blood tests If you have symptoms, or a physical exam was suspicious for recurrence, your doctor may order blood tests. In addition to a complete blood count (CBC), testing may measure blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. These check your kidney function. Liver function tests may also be ordered. Survivorship In addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. This includes keeping alert for symptoms of cancer recurrence. See Part 6: Survivorship for more information. Recurrence This section discusses cervical cancer that does not improve with treatment (persistent) or that returns after treatment (recurrent). If your doctor suspects recurrence based on your symptoms or a physical exam, you will have imaging tests to check. This could include CT, PET, and/or MRI. Surgery to look inside the body (exploratory surgery) may be helpful in some cases. The goal is to learn the extent of the cancer. This can help guide treatment decisions. Biomarker testing Biomarkers are features of a cancer that can help guide treatment. Biomarkers are often mutations (changes) in particular genes. They can also be proteins that are made in response to the cancer. Biomarker testing is recommended for all recurrent cervical cancers. The results help determine whether treatment with certain targeted therapies is an option. The results can also be used to determine whether you can join certain clinical trials. Some doctors order biomarker testing early in the course of treatment. Many doctors wait and order it only if the cancer returns or spreads.

Diagnosis typically begins with imaging, with MRI being particularly useful for initial identification. However, a definitive diagnosis and accurate characterization require a stereotactic biopsy and subsequent molecular and histological analysis of the tissue.\\n\\nGliomas cause symptoms primarily by putting pressure on or invading healthy brain tissue. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, cognitive impairments, weakness, personality changes, vision problems, and sensory disturbances. They are also linked to an increased risk of blood clots. Treatment is notably challenging due to the tumor's invasive nature, and while gliomas are usually treatable with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, they are generally considered not curable.<SEP>A glioma is a type of malignant brain tumor that develops from glial cells, invades normal brain tissue, and is challenging to treat.<SEP>Glioma is a type of brain tumor that can be treated but often recurs, with different grades affecting growth rate and symptoms.\"}\n{\"entity\": \"Local CSCC\", \"type\": \"concept\", \"description\": \"Local CSCC, which stands for Local Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (also commonly referred to as squamous cell skin cancer), is a form of skin cancer that is confined to its original site. It is specifically defined by the absence of spread, or metastasis, to nearby lymph nodes. In some descriptions, this local confinement is further clarified as cancer that has not spread beyond the original site.\\n\\nThe primary and most common treatment for Local CSCC is surgical removal. Following treatment, this diagnosis necessitates adherence to specific, structured follow-up monitoring schedules.

Test results Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) Results from blood and tissue tests, imaging studies, and biopsy will determine your treatment plan. It is important you understand what these tests mean. Ask questions about your test results. Online patient portals are one way to access your test results. Please wait to discuss the results with your doctor or health care team. Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment. Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support. These can be different people for different tasks or change over time. Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible, or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments. Write down questions and ask a friend or family member to take notes. Caregivers should ask questions, too. Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results. Keep a list of contact information for your care team and update your primary care physician (PCP) regarding any changes. Include details about the specific type of cancer, treatment, and dates in your contact list. Set up a patient portal or health record account if it’s available, which can help you track your appointments and communicate with your care team. In many places the MyChart or portal messages are not immediately seen by a nurse or physician, so ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency. For possible tests and procedures, see Guide General health tests Some general health tests are described next. Medical history A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.

For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to help your tissues and organs show up more clearly in the picture. Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour. The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells. The radioactive part of the tracer lets your care team see how your cells are using the Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) A very common type of skin cancer Occurs more often in lighter-skinned people Is commonly found in areas of the body exposed to sun, especially the head and neck Rarely spreads to distant areas of the body Can spread in the area where it first forms If not treated can cause severe skin damage and even death Most people (over ) can be cured by completely removing the CSCC substance. This helps them find any usage that is not normal. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. Confirmed CSCC Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your doctor will follow up with: A complete head-to-toe skin exam to look for other lesions An exam of the lymph nodes Cancer cells can travel through blood and a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other parts of the body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease. If your lymph nodes feel larger than they should be, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes (this is also called “nodal disease”). To find out, your doctor will use a needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph node for testing.

follow-up testing is so important.People with bladder cancer need regular follow-up tests for many years to check if the cancer has returned.The most common kind of bladder cancer starts in the urothelial cells, which are stretchy cells that line the inside of the bladder.Urothelial cells also form the inner layer in the rest of the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, the ureters, and the urethra.Cancer of the urothelium can start in these areas instead of the bladder, although it’s less common.Other (non-urothelial) types of bladder cancer are much less common.These include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma.How is bladder cancer found?Bladder cancer is usually found when a person has symptoms.A symptom is a problem or feeling that may signal a disease or condition.The most common symptom of bladder cancer, and the one that usually appears first, is having blood in your urine (hematuria).How does blood get into urine?Bladder tumors are likely to release a little blood, which mixes with the urine in your bladder.The blood may turn your urine pink or bright red.Or, if there isn’t enough blood to be visible, your urine may look normal.But your clinical team can still detect blood by looking at a sample of the urine under a microscope.Blood in the urine can be caused by many other things besides bladder cancer.The most common cause is an infection in the urinary tract.So anyone with blood in their urine should see a health care provider to get their urine tested.\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"If any

Blood tests Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. They require a sample of blood, which is removed through a needle placed into a vein in your arm. Be prepared to have many blood tests during AML treatment and recovery to check treatment results, blood counts, and the health of organs like your liver and kidneys. Some possible tests are described next. The list starts with more common tests. Complete blood count and differential A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture of your overall health. AML often causes low counts of healthy blood cells, but it can also present with a high number of abnormal, malignant (abnormal) white blood cells. There are several types of white blood cells. A differential counts the number of each type of white blood cell. It also checks if the counts are in balance with each other. This test may show a high number of blasts in the blood. Your care team will pay particular attention to the following CBC measurements: Hemoglobin (Hgb) is a measurement of how much oxygen can move through blood and if a red blood cell transfusion might be needed. Platelets (PLTs) are cells that make the clot, thus preventing or stopping the bleeding. h An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measures cells that fight bacteria and protect us from infections Blasts or leukemia cells can sometimes be detected in the blood and usually are reported as a percentage of cells. Comprehensive metabolic panel A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood. It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. Creatinine Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles. Every person generates a fixed amount of creatinine every day based on how much muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the blood tells how well the kidneys are working. Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys aren’t working as well as they were when someone had lower levels of creatinine. Blood urea nitrogen Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. A high level of BUN can be a sign your kidneys aren’t working well.

If your images seem to show a glioma, the next step may be a biopsy. Biopsy If imaging scans show something that may be a glioma, your care providers will usually want to take a sample and evaluate it. A surgical procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for testing is called a biopsy. Getting a biopsy of a tumor is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis of your condition. A biopsy also gives your care team clues on how to treat your tumor. A surgical procedure called a resection does double duty as both a biopsy and a treatment. In a resection, your neurosurgeon will attempt to remove the entire tumor or as much of the tumor as safely possible. Removing the tumor could relieve symptoms and help you live longer. Also, a large sample of the tumor can give the most complete pathology results. Sometimes a resection isn’t possible. This happens when the glioma is in a difficult place to reach or is located in a vital part of the brain. In these cases, your provider will schedule a standard biopsy. There are 2 types of standard biopsies for gliomas: stereotactic biopsy and open biopsy. Stereotactic biopsy This is a very precise procedure that’s often used when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach or vital area. It aims to remove only enough of the tumor to make a diagnosis. A stereotactic biopsy is done by a neurosurgeon in an operating room. First, you’ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny markers around your head to aid the surgery.

How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface.

In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don’t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out\"}\n{\"reference_id\": \"\", \"content\": \"into smaller airways called the bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli. From here, oxygen is transferred into your blood. Lung cancer Almost all lung cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. Lung carcinomas start in the cells that line the airways of the lungs. The airways of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles, and alveoli. There are different types of lung carcinoma. The main types are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Other types of cancer can spread to the lungs, such as breast cancer. Breast cancer that has spread to the lungs is still called breast cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a group of cancers that are the most common type of lung cancer. NSCLC can be broken down into subtypes by looking at the cancer cells under a microscope. This is called histology. Adenocarcinoma starts in the mucusmaking cells that line the alveoli (small air sacs). This is the most common subtype. About 4 out of 10 lung cancers are adenocarcinomas. This is the most common type of lung cancer seen in those who don’t smoke or who don’t have a history of smoking. More information on NSCLC and SCLC is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in the flat cells that line the inside of the airways (bronchi) in the lungs. About 3 out of 10 lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma starts in large cells that can grow anywhere in the lungs. This accounts for 5 out of 10 NSCLCs. Small cell lung cancer Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-dividing cancer of the neuroendocrine cells. Under a microscope, the cancer cells look small and oval- or oat-shaped. It is the second most common type of lung cancer. About 1 out of every 10 lung cancers are SCLC. Early detection The goal of lung cancer screening is to find lung cancer at an early stage, even before there are any symptoms. This is when treatment will be most successful. Early detection of lung cancer helps prevent death. Together, you and your health care provider should discuss if screening is right for you.

Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer.

They can break away from a tumor, spread outside the lung, and form more tumors. NSCLC is a type of lung carcinoma Almost all lung cancers are carcinomas (karsin-OH-mas). Lung carcinomas form from cells that line the airways of the lungs. The airways inside the lungs are the bronchi, bronchioli, and alveoli. NSCLC is the most common lung carcinoma. Other lung carcinomas are neuroendocrine tumors. Information on lung neuroendocrine tumors can be found at Airways of the lungs The air you breathe moves through a series of airways. It travels down your throat and through your windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into two airways called bronchi. Inside the lung, each bronchus divides into smaller airways called the bronchioli. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli. Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli.

Key points Small cell lung cancer forms from cells that line the inner airways of the lungs. It’s a cancer that can be aggressive and grows fast. This chapter gives you the basics of small cell lung cancer. What is lung cancer? The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. They deliver oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The transfer of these gases in and out of the body is called respiration. Lung cancers form from cells that line the airways of the lungs. The lungs' airways are called the bronchus, bronchioli, and alveoli. Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells. They break the rules of cell growth. Cancer cells make many new cancer cells. They also do not die when they should. This overgrowth of cancer cells becomes a mass of tissue called a tumor. Cancer cells grow out of control. They can grow through the airway and into the lung tissue. They can grow through the lung wall and invade other body parts. Cancer cells can break away from a tumor and spread. They can enter the bloodstream or a fluid called lymph and spread to other places. This out-of-control cell growth can harm the body. Cancer cells crowd out and overwhelm normal cells. Without enough normal cells, cancer cells can cause organs to stop working. Scientists have learned a great deal about cancer.

Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence.

In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care.

The ectocervix is the outer part that extends into the vagina. The endocervix is the canal between the vagina and the body of the uterus. Most cervical cancers and pre-cancers start in the ectocervix portion of the transformation zone. Cervical changes Cervical cancer starts as areas of abnormal, microscopic cells on the surface of the cervix. These changes are known as cervical dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Risk factors The risk factor most strongly linked with cervical cancer is long-term infection with HPV, a common sexually transmitted infection. h A vaccine that protects against 9 different strains of HPV, including the highest-risk strains, is available in the United States. Types of cervical cancer Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type, followed by adenocarcinoma. Adenosquamous carcinomas are less common. Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC) is a rare and aggressive type of cervical cancer. 2 Testing and staging Biopsy Health history and physical exam Blood tests Imaging Fertility and pregnancy Other testing and care Staging Cancer care plan Key points Your doctors will make a treatment plan just for you. First, they will need to gather information about the cancer and your general health. This chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan. Biopsy Cervical biopsy and pathologic review A cervical biopsy involves removing small samples of tissue from the cervix. It is the most commonly used procedure to diagnose cervical cancer. Samples may be taken from the rounded, bottom part of the cervix (ectocervix) and/or from the endocervical canal. The removed tissue is examined by a specialized doctor called a pathologist. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in evaluating cells and tissues to diagnose disease. The pathologist looks for abnormal areas, including areas of cancer or pre-cancer. The pathologist also determines the type of cervical cancer, when possible.

A vaccine that protects against 9 different strains of HPV, including the highest-risk strains, is available in the United States. While previously only recommended for routine use in adolescents and young adults, vaccination is now an option for adults aged 45 and under. There are two other HPV vaccines available in other parts of the world. One protects against HPV-16 and HPV-18 only. The other targets these and two additional types. The vaccine works best in younger people (ideally under age 13) because they are less likely to have been exposed to HPV. And, while the vaccine can prevent new HPV infections, it does not treat existing HPV infections or HPVrelated cancer. Other risk factors Other risk factors for cervical cancer are listed below. Some of these lead to a higher risk because they either increase the risk of being exposed to HPV or they weaken the immune system, which can make it harder for the body to clear HPV infection. A history of smoking Having given birth more than once (called “high parity” or multiparity) Oral contraceptive (birth control) use Being sexually active at an early age A high number of sexual partners A history of sexually transmitted infection Certain autoimmune diseases A weakened immune system due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, for example Types of cervical cancer Most cervical cancers start in the ectocervix. The ectocervix is lined with squamous cells. Cancer that forms in squamous cells is called a squamous cell carcinoma. About 2 out of 10 cervical cancers form in the endocervical canal. The endocervix is lined with cells that make mucus. These cells are referred to as glandular, gland-like, secretory, or columnar cells. Cancers that form in glandular cells are called adenocarcinomas. Less commonly, the cancer may contain both squamous and adenocarcinoma cells. These cancers are referred to as adenosquamous carcinomas. They are sometimes called “mixed” tumors.
