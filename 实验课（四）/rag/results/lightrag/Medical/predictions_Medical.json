These cells normally function by constantly dividing to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin's surface. Basal cell carcinoma occurs when some of these basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] About basal cell skin cancer What is basal cell skin cancer?
