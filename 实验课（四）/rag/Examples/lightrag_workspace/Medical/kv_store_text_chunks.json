    "content": "About basal cell skin cancer What is basal cell skin cancer? How is basal cell skin cancer treated? What can you do to get the best care? Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer. About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States. The good news is it can be cured in most cases. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Keep reading to find out more. What is basal cell skin cancer? Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types. If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable. This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads). Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells. Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control. This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk. But it can occur anywhere on the body. Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck. Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek. Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body’s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet? Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature. It has 3 layers: Epidermis – The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis – The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. Hypodermis – The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue. Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis. It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells – These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis. Basal cells – Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin’s surface. Melanocytes – Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin. Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin, and eye color. It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. This book is only about basal cell skin cancer. For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Signs and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it’s most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes. In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don’t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border. It can be mistaken for a normal mole. Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths. Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early. To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer. Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds. UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells. DNA controls how cells grow and function. If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control. You’re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors. A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer. Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure – UV light (radiation) that comes from the sun or tanning beds increases your risk. Fair skin, red or blond hair, or light eye color – People with lighter-colored skin are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer because melanin (skin pigment) filters out the sun's harmful UV rays. Age – Risk increases with age because sun exposure builds up over time. But skin cancer is becoming more common in younger people. History of skin cancer – If you or someone in your family has had skin cancer, you’re more likely to develop any type of skin cancer. Radiation therapy – Radiation treatment for other conditions, especially at a young age, can cause skin cancer. Immune suppression – People with weakened immune systems from organ transplants or autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for basal cell skin cancer. How is basal cell skin cancer treated? Basal cell skin cancer is highly treatable and curable. Catching it and treating it early is key. Surgery is the most common treatment for basal cell skin cancer. In some cases, radiation therapy or systemic therapy might be used to treat it. Following your treatment, you will have full skin exams with your doctor at least once a year. Between these periods, prevention is important. See Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence for more information. Recurrence is when basal cell skin cancer returns to the area where it was originally found, or it has metastasized (spread) to the lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. But there are several options for how to treat it. Read more about how your cancer is treated in Chapter 3: Types of treatment and Chapter 4: Treatment by risk and recurrence. What can you do",

It is important you understand what these tests mean, so keep reading for more details.\n7 Adrenal glands 8 Adrenal tumors 8 Adrenocortical carcinoma 9 Signs and symptoms 9 Risk factors 10 Key points Adrenal tumors form in one or both adrenal glands. Adrenal glands produce hormones that affect your body in different ways. This chapter reviews the basics of adrenal tumors. Adrenal glands Your body has 2 adrenal glands. They are located on top of each kidney. Adrenal glands are small, yellow glands that are important to the body’s endocrine system. The endocrine system is made up of tissues and organs that produce hormones. Hormones are chemical substances that are made in one part of the body and carried through the bloodstream to other parts of the body where they help control how organs or cells work. Each adrenal gland has 2 main parts: Adrenal cortex – This is the outer part of the adrenal gland. The adrenal cortex makes 3 main hormones: cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). These hormones control metabolism, blood pressure, and body features (such as hair growth and body shape). Adrenal medulla – This is the inner part of the adrenal gland. The medulla makes 3 hormones: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These hormones control the body’s response to stress. This includes the “fight or flight” surge of adrenaline. Adrenal glands Adrenal glands are small, triangle-shaped glands found on the top of the kidneys. These glands make hormones that help to regulate your immune system, response to stress, metabolism, and other functions. AnatomyoftheAdrenalGland Adrenal tumors Adrenal tumors can occur in one or both adrenal glands. Most adrenal gland tumors are benign (not cancer). Adrenal tumors often do not cause symptoms and are found through an imaging test such as a CT or MRI scan performed for another reason. Adrenal tumors are categorized in the following ways: Benign (not cancer) adrenal tumors do not metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. This type of tumor is often found by chance through imaging tests done for an unrelated issue. Functional adrenal tumors are usually benign, although some are capable of becoming cancerous and spreading. Benign functional tumors can still produce hormones and may be found during tests for hormone-related symptoms. Malignant adrenal tumors are cancerous tumors. They are rare, with about 300 to 500 people being diagnosed each year. Certain genetic conditions may increase the risk for these tumors. treatment. An adenoma that produces too much of the hormone aldosterone is called an aldosteronoma. Whereas, an adenoma that produces too much of the hormone cortisol (stress hormone) causes a condition called Cushing syndrome. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) – Although it is the most common type of adrenal gland cancer, it is very rare and affects approximately 1 to 2 people out of every 1 million. Adrenocortical carcinoma begins in the adrenal cortex. It can be a functioning or nonfunctioning tumor. If the tumor is functioning, it may produce more than 1 hormone. Neuroblastoma – This rare type of adrenal tumor is cancerous. It affects children ages 5 and under, though it is most often found in infants. Neuroblastoma can spread to",

They include the following: Adrenocortical carcinoma Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an adrenal cancer that starts in one or both of the adrenal glands. It can occur at any age. But it’s most likely to affect children ages 5 and under, and adults in their 40s and 50s. If caught early, adrenal cancer can be cured. However, if the cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence. Signs and symptoms Half of those with adrenal cancer will have symptoms caused by hormones produced by the tumor. Others may experience symptoms if the tumor has grown so large that it is pressing on nearby organs. If you have any of the signs or symptoms listed below, make sure to discuss them with your health care provider. Symptoms of adrenal cancer may include: Weight gain Muscle weakness Pink or purple stretch marks on the skin Hormonal changes such as excess facial hair, hair loss on the head, irregular periods, enlarged breast tissue, and shrinking testicles Nausea Vomiting Abdominal bloating Back pain Fever Loss of appetite Loss of weight without trying Risk factors There are no known causes for most adrenal tumors. However, some genetic (hereditary) conditions can put you at risk for developing an adrenal tumor. Hereditary conditions are mutations passed down from biological parent to child through genes. Those with one of the conditions listed below might have a higher risk for developing an adrenal tumor. This accounts for only a small portion of cases. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Carney complex Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) Hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndrome Li-Fraumeni syndrome Lynch syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) Some of these conditions can also put one at risk for developing a kidney tumor.

Testing is used to diagnose and plan treatment for adrenal tumors. This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. Test results Adrenal tumors will be diagnosed based on a series of test results. Your diagnosis will determine your treatment plan. It is important you understand what these tests mean. Keep these things in mind: Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. Write down questions and take notes during appointments. Don’t be afraid to ask your care team questions. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you. Get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific disease. Organize your papers. Create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. You can do the same on your computer. Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. Add it to your phone.

Add a section for questions and to take notes. Bring your medical binder to appointments. You never know when you might need it! General health tests Medical history A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Tell your doctor about any symptoms you have. A medical or health history will help determine which treatment is best for you. Family history Some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. Physical exam During a physical exam, a health care provider may: Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate Check your weight and height Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. Tell your doctor if you feel pain. Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. Tell your doctor if you have felt any lumps or have any pain. NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Adrenal Tumors, 2022 What is your family health history? Some cancers and other diseases run in families—those who are related to you through genes passed down from parent to child. This information is called a family health history. You can ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. For relatives who have died, ask about the cause and age of death. Start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. Next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, niece and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. Write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. Some of the questions to ask include: Do you have any chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, or health conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Have you had any other diseases, such as cancer or stroke? How old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? What is our family’s ancestry—from what countries did our ancestors originate? Imaging tests Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. A radiologist, an expert in interpreting test images, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. Your test results will be discussed with you. CT scan A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed three-dimensional (3D) picture. In most cases, contrast will be used. Contrast Contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. Contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. It might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). The contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine after the test. The types of contrast vary but are different for CT than for MRI. Tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and prednisone (steroids), to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys are not working well. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays. Contrast might be used. An MRI may be used as an initial test, to check treatment results, and to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to help see cancer cells in the body. PET scans are performed about an hour after the tracer is injected. PET scans are combined with CT or MRI scans (PET/CT or PET/MRI) to determine where the cancer cells are located. This combined test is considered to be more accurate than either scan alone. Types of PET scans that can be helpful for those with adrenal tumors include FDG-PET and SSTRPET. FDG-PET/CT scan An FDG-PET scan uses a radioactive type of sugar (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) as its tracer. Active cancer cells use sugar faster than normal cells. This will make the cells",

FDG-PET/CT scan An FDG-PET scan uses a radioactive type of sugar (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) as its tracer. Active cancer cells use sugar faster than normal cells. This will make the cells look brighter in pictures. Many adrenal tumors are not fast-growing and not very bright on FDG-PET scans. FDG-PET scans can help determine if neuroendocrine tumors are becoming more aggressive. SSTR-PET/CT scan A somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist is a protein found on the surface of cells that bind to a hormone called somatostatin. Somatostatin helps to control other hormones in the body. SSTRs are found on many different types of cells. A SSTR-PET uses a tracer that binds to these SSTRs. Blood tests Blood tests are used to look for signs of hormone secretion or to see how well you are responding to certain treatments. Biochemical tests Biochemical tests measure substances like hormones in blood, urine, and/or saliva that may be made by the adrenal tumor. Symptoms may be seen when your body makes too much of a hormone. Your doctor may consider these tests if you may have an adrenal tumor or syndromes caused by a tumor.

It is highly treatable and can often be cured. Squamous cell skin cancer is a common skin cancer, especially in fair-skinned people. It is the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma. The third type—melanoma—is much less common than the other types but can be more aggressive. Because they do not behave like melanoma, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are often referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancers or keratinocyte carcinomas. Cancer that starts in a squamous cell is called a squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells are found in the top layer of the skin. They can also be found in other areas of the body, such as the lungs, thyroid, and esophagus. These types are treated differently than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell skin cancers often begin as scaly patches on the skin that can become solid and misshapen. This cancer is also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). This patient guide is about squamous cell skin cancer only. The terms “squamous cell skin cancer” and “CSCC” are used interchangeably throughout this guide. Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold. Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin). Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue. Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis. There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin. Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer. Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin’s surface. As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells. Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin. Melanin is produced in the melanocytes. Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes. In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease. For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer. The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next. Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily. People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer. People who work outdoors are also at higher risk. Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun. Sun exposure Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over a long period of time, frequent tanning, and getting sunburns. Indoor tanning Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer. Using all types of indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds) increases the risk of getting any type of skin cancer. Environmental toxins People who are often exposed to pollutants such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be found in soil, water, and air) can experience skin damage that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns. This is known as Marjolin",

Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns. This is known as Marjolin’s ulcer. CSCC that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come back after treatment. Actinic keratoses An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin caused by exposure to the sun over time that may become squamous cell skin cancer. Actinic keratoses vary in appearance, and may be red, white, tan, or pink in color. They may appear as small scaly spots (lesions) or stick out from the skin like bumps. Some may even look like warts. Having actinic keratoses means you are at increased risk of developing squamous cell skin cancer. It is important that you have your skin looked at by a doctor or dermatologist. Actinic keratosis on the hand An actinic keratosis is an area of rough skin caused by being in the sun over time. Actinic keratosis on top of head Actinic keratoses can vary in appearance and may be red, white, tan, or pink in color. Genetic syndromes Having certain genetic syndromes means you are at higher risk of getting squamous cell skin cancer. While there are many, these syndromes include: h Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a condition in which the body isn’t able to repair damage to DNA caused by sunlight. Skin cells with a lot of DNA damage can eventually become skin cancers. Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a form of a rare, inherited skin disorder that causes the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma to the skin can cause painful blisters. NCCN recommends that people with these or other genetic syndromes should be referred to a cancer center with expertise in CSCC prevention and treatment. NCCN also recommends that those with a genetic risk of skin cancer receive counseling from someone with expertise in cancer genetics throughout the treatment process. This might be a genetic counselor, medical geneticist, endocrinologist, oncologist, surgeon, or an oncology nurse. Weakened immune system When your immune system is weakened, your body has trouble fighting off viruses, bacteria, and fungi. This can lead to infections and other health risks. Having a weakened immune system can put you at risk of squamous cell skin cancer. An example of when this happens is after organ transplantation. If you received an organ from another person, you likely take drugs to stop your body from attacking the donated organ. These drugs, called immunosuppressants, also reduce the body’s ability to fight infection and disease. The immune system also may not work well if you have other health conditions, such as: Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph nodes) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cancer of white blood cells in bone marrow) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS Any of these conditions can weaken the immune system, which can increase the risk of getting squamous cell skin cancer. Everyone with this condition should undergo skin cancer screening on a regular basis. Diagnosis If you have an area of abnormal-looking skin (called a lesion) that looks like it could be skin cancer, the next step is testing. This will likely include: h A full health history A close examination of the lesion(s) A skin biopsy to remove a sample of the lesion and test it for cancer (this is the only way to know for sure if there’s cancer) Imaging scans if cancer may be deep within the skin or spread to other parts of the body Biopsy If a concerning lesion is found on your skin, some or all of it will be removed and sent to a lab to be looked at under a microscope. This is called a skin biopsy. A biopsy is needed to diagnose squamous cell skin cancer. Your sample should be reviewed by a pathologist. The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of your cells. There are several ways to do a skin biopsy. Your doctor will choose one based on the size of the affected area, where it is on your body, and other factors. Any biopsy is likely to leave at least a small scar. Different methods can result in different types of scars. Talk to your doctor about the type of biopsy and the risk of scarring before you have the biopsy. No matter which type of biopsy is done, it should remove as much of the suspected area as possible for an accurate diagnosis to be made. Skin biopsies are done using a local anesthetic (numbing medicine), which is injected into the area with a very small needle. You will likely feel a small prick and a little stinging as the medicine is injected, but you should not feel any pain during the biopsy. Skin shave biopsy A skin shave biopsy can be done on the skin surface (superficial) or deeper. Superficial shave biopsies are useful for very flat skin lesions. This type of biopsy removes the top layer of skin (epidermis) and part of the dermis using a tool similar to a razor. Skin punch biopsy During a skin punch biopsy, a small piece of skin and connective tissue are removed using a hand-held tool. Stitches are often used to close the opening in the skin. Excision biopsy During an excision biopsy, all or part of the lesion is removed. This biopsy can be done in Create a medical binder A medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your",

This biopsy can be done in Create a medical binder A medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. Make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. It will be helpful when getting a second opinion. Choose a binder that meets your needs. Consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. Create folders for insurance forms, test types (blood, imaging, pathology, radiology, and genetics), treatments, and procedures. Organize items in the folder by date. Use online patient portals to view your test results and other records. Download or print the records to add to your binder. Add a section for questions and to take notes. Bring your medical binder to appointments. You never know when you might need it! a doctor’s office or at a hospital. You may want to ask how the biopsy incision will be closed, as there are several options that can be used. Imaging tests Your doctor may use imaging scans to see if you have cancer beyond the suspiciouslooking lesion, such as in the bone, nerves, or surrounding deep soft tissue. You may have a computed tomography (CT) scan or an MRI. A CT scan is a procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body. The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-dimensional (3-D) views of tissues and organs. An MRI is a procedure that uses radio waves, a powerful magnet, and a computer to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body. For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to help your tissues and organs show up more clearly in the picture. Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour. The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use. Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells. The radioactive part of the tracer lets your care team see how your cells are using the Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) A very common type of skin cancer Occurs more often in lighter-skinned people Is commonly found in areas of the body exposed to sun, especially the head and neck Rarely spreads to distant areas of the body Can spread in the area where it first forms If not treated can cause severe skin damage and even death Most people (over ) can be cured by completely removing the CSCC substance. This helps them find any usage that is not normal. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. Not all bright spots are cancer. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. Confirmed CSCC Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your doctor will follow up with: A complete head-to-toe skin exam to look for other lesions An exam of the lymph nodes Cancer cells can travel through blood and a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other parts of the body. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid. They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease. If your lymph nodes feel larger than they should be, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes (this is also called “nodal disease”). To find out, your doctor will use a needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph node for testing. Squamous cell skin cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes is referred to as “local” squamous cell skin cancer.  See Part 3 for more information on local CSCC. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, it is called “regional” squamous cell skin cancer.  See Part 4 for more information on regional CSCC. Kno“wing there is treatment available gave me hope at diagnosis and for the future. Key points Squamous cell skin cancer is the second most common type of skin cancer. It is highly treatable and can often be cured. Squamous cell skin cancer is most commonly caused by getting sunburns or spending too much time in the sun over many years. h An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin that has a higher chance of becoming squamous cell skin cancer. You may be more likely to get squamous cell skin cancer if you have actinic keratoses, a weakened immune system, or certain genetic syndromes. Squamous cell skin cancer can form in old wounds, burns, or scars. This is called Marjolin’s ulcer and it can be harder to treat. Testing for CSCC could include a full health history, an examination of any lesions, and a skin biopsy to remove a sample and test it for cancer. Imaging scans will also be done if cancer goes deeper into the skin or has spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can travel through blood and",

Superficial treatments Surgery Radiation therapy Systemic therapy Clinical trials Key points This chapter describes the types of treatment you may have for squamous cell skin cancer. The best treatment for you will depend on the extent of the cancer, whether surgery is a suitable option, and your personal preferences. Not everyone will receive the same treatment. Who is on my care team? After being diagnosed with squamous cell skin cancer, knowing what to do next can be confusing. Aside from your oncologist (your cancer doctor), there are others who may be involved in your cancer care. Some members of your care team will be with you throughout your treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and let them get to know you. Depending on your diagnosis, your care team might include the following: Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer. They also do skin exams and can teach you how to do them on your own. Mohs surgeons are doctors (usually dermatologists) who have advanced training in Mohs surgery and reconstruction after surgery. They remove the tumor, ensure no more cancer can be seen using a microscope, and can restore the appearance of the affected area with reconstructive surgery. Surgical oncologists are doctors who are trained to diagnose and surgically treat and remove cancerous tumors, including those that have spread beyond the skin. Medical oncologists are doctors who specialize in prescribing cancer-treatment drugs (chemotherapy). They are trained to diagnose and treat cancer using medicines that may be taken by mouth, be injected, or be given intravenously (through a vein). Pathologists are doctors who are trained to study tissue and cells removed during a biopsy under a microscope to determine the stage of a cancerous tumor. Plastic surgeons are doctors who can remove cancer as well as reconstruct, restore, and repair body parts. They may work with a pathologist at the time of your surgery for more immediate results. They are trained to close a wound after surgery, especially if it involves deeper tissue where general anesthesia may be needed. Head and neck surgeons are doctors who are trained to treat conditions (cancerous and noncancerous) of the deeper parts of the head and neck, including the ears, nose, and throat. Radiation oncologists are doctors who are trained to use different types of radiation therapy. Pharmacists are medical professionals who are trained to prepare and give out medicine and explain their proper use and any side effects. Some pharmacists specifically work with people with cancer. Geneticists are doctors who study how traits are passed down from parents to children through genes. They are trained to diagnose and treat genetic disorders and counsel people and families at risk. Oncology nurses are nurses who provide hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects. Sometimes, these experts are called nurse navigators. You know your body better than anyone. Help other team members understand: How you feel What you need h What is working and what is not Your goals for treatment Keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. This will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know whom to contact with questions or concerns. Superficial treatments Treatments that affect only the top layer of the skin are called superficial treatments. They may be used to treat the earliest form of squamous cell skin cancer, called Bowen’s disease. They are also used for actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions) that are in the same general area as the Bowen’s lesion. Photodynamic therapy In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a lightsensitive drug is applied to the area. When exposed to light (either red or blue light in the doctor’s office, or shaded outdoor light), the drug becomes active and kills cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy A drug applied to the skin becomes active and kills cancer cells when exposed to light. Common side effects of PDT include itching or burning when the liquid is applied, pain during the red or blue light exposure, and itching and redness for a few days after treatment. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy (also called cryosurgery) freezes and destroys precancerous and cancerous cells using a very cold liquid or tool. Liquid nitrogen is often used. Cryotherapy sometimes causes a burning sensation during treatment. A blister and scab will form, which heals over 2 to 3 weeks. Skin darkening or lightening can happen while it is healing. Topical therapies Topical therapies are treatments that are applied to the skin. 5-fluorouracil (Carac, Efudex, Fluoroplex) and imiquimod (Aldara) are prescription creams used to treat early CSCC and actinic keratoses. 5-fluorouracil (also called 5-FU) is chemotherapy applied directly to the skin, unlike most chemotherapy that is put into the bloodstream. A cream called calcipotriene (Sorilux, Dovonex) is often used with 5-fluorouracil to treat actinic keratosis. Calcipotriene is a form of vitamin D that activates the skin’s immune system. Imiquimod belongs to",

Imiquimod belongs to a group of drugs known as immune response modifiers. This cream can help fight abnormal skin growths by activating the immune system to damage abnormal skin cells. Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) is another topical therapy used to treat actinic keratosis. Tirbanibulin is a type of medication called a microtubule inhibitor. It works by killing fast-growing cells, such as the abnormal cells that cause actinic keratoses. It is applied to the face or scalp 1 time a day for 5 days in a row (consecutive) using a single-dose packet with each application. Thickening of the outer layer of skin is known as hyperkeratosis. The goal is to soften and break down this thick top layer before treatment. For hyperkeratotic (thick and rough) actinic keratoses, one or more of the following may be used before treatment with the therapies described above. Cryotherapy Cryotherapy freezes and destroys cancer cells using a very cold liquid or tool. h Topical tazarotene (a retinoid product related to vitamin A) Curettage (scraping away skin with a spoon-shaped tool) Topical keratolytics (also called topical urea, lactic acid, or salicylic acid) Other therapies that are sometimes used for actinic keratoses include topical diclofenac, chemical peels (trichloroacetic acid), and resurfacing techniques such as laser or dermabrasion. Topical therapies for squamous cell skin cancer may cause burning, redness, itching, and pain in the treated area. Sun-damaged skin may also need to be re-treated with topical therapies from time to time. Surgery Different types of surgery can be used to treat squamous cell skin cancers. Most surgery procedures involve a form of excision, which Mohs surgery This procedure allows the surgeon to know right away whether all cancer was removed. means cutting out the tumor along with a small margin of normal skin. Curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E) C&E is done in a medical office with local numbing to the area. In this method, the visible tumor is first scraped off using a thin tool with a sharp loop or spoon at the end. Next, an electric needle is used to cauterize (burn) the base of the wound. This usually kills any remaining cancer cells and helps stop bleeding. This two-step system of scraping then burning may be done up to three times in the same session. C&E is a recommended option for early CSCC on the surface of the skin that has not spread to lymph nodes. PDEMA/Mohs surgery Peripheral and deep en face margin assessment (PDEMA) is a type of surgery often used for treatment on the head, face, hands, feet, shins, and genital areas, because it can remove the cancer while sparing as much normal tissue as possible. It should be performed by surgeons who have special training and experience in this procedure. All forms of PDEMA allow for complete testing of the edges of any removed tissue. Mohs surgery is the most common form of PDEMA. Mohs surgery can be done in a medical office or surgical suite and should be done by a dermatologic (skin) surgeon who has special training and experience in this procedure. Most patients remain awake during the procedure. After the area is numbed, the visible tumor is first removed using a scalpel. Next, a thin layer of surrounding tissue is removed from under and around the wound. The edges and underside of this tissue are evaluated by the Mohs surgeon using a microscope while you wait. If cancer cells are seen by the surgeon, another thin layer of tissue is removed only from the area of the wound where the cancer was seen. When a removed layer shows no cancer cells at its edges, the procedure is over. Standard surgical excision Standard surgical excision is another option for treating squamous cell skin cancer. A standard surgical excision (removal) can be done in a medical office while you are awake. After the area is numbed, the doctor removes the tumor and an area of normal tissue surrounding it with a scalpel blade. The edges of the removed tissue are called the surgical margin. PDEMA can also be used with standard surgical excision. The tissue is then sent for testing. A pathologist examines thin samples of Mohs surgery Mohs surgery is a recommended option for CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes and is preferred for very high-risk local CSCC. the tissue under a microscope to see if there are cancer cells at the margin. Lymph node dissection If lymph nodes near a squamous cell skin cancer tumor are enlarged, the doctor might biopsy them to check for cancer cells. If the lymph node biopsy shows cancer, sometimes many nodes might be removed in a more extensive surgery called a lymph node dissection. The nodes are then looked at under a microscope for signs of cancer. This type of surgery is more extensive than surgery on the skin and is usually done while you are under general anesthesia (in a deep sleep). Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to which cancer cells most likely spread from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there is more than one sentinel lymph node. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgery that removes tissue samples to examine sentinel nodes. The lymph nodes will be checked for cancer cells by a",

Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to which cancer cells most likely spread from a primary tumor. Sometimes, there is more than one sentinel lymph node. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgery that removes tissue samples to examine sentinel nodes. The lymph nodes will be checked for cancer cells by a pathologist in a lab. Sometimes people can have an SLNB at the same time as surgery. The results will be used to stage the cancer and plan treatment. To locate the sentinel lymph node(s), your surgeon will inject a radioactive, blue-colored substance into your skin near the tumor. The substance will drain into the sentinel lymph nodes. Your surgeon will identify the sentinel lymph nodes using a device and remove them through a small cut in your skin. This procedure is generally done under general anesthesia. Wound healing after surgery After surgery, there are different ways a wound can heal. Some wounds heal better without stitches. A wound might be left open (rather than being stitched together) and left to heal by itself, filling in and closing up naturally. This is called secondary intention healing. It could mean you will need regular dressings to the area for up to 6 weeks, but the full time to heal depends on the size, depth, and area of the wound. A linear closure is another common form of wound healing. The surgeon will cut a small amount of extra skin to change the shape of the wound from a circle to a fusiform (an oval that looks like a football) to help the surgeon stitch the wound together in a line. Other wounds may need skin grafts or other types of surgery (such as rearranging skin, known as “flapping”) to heal well and lessen scarring. A skin graft is a patch of skin that is removed by surgery from one area of the body and transplanted (attached) to another area. This may be done the same day or a few days after a PDEMA/Mohs procedure or standard surgical excision. After surgery, your skin will continue healing for a period of between 6 to 10 weeks. Scar treatment and aftercare for the skin around the wound will likely be recommended. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (RT) is a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy – from electrons (beams), photons (high-energy x-rays), or protons (charged particles) -- to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy usually involves 5 daily brief treatments per week over 3 to 7 weeks. Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist (a doctor who is an expert in radiation treatment). Types of radiation therapy There are two general types of radiation therapy that can be used to treat CSCC: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. In EBRT, a beam of radiation is directed at the tumor from a machine. The two most common types of external beam radiation for CSCC are electrons and photons. Electrons are used to treat superficial tumors. Photons are used to treat deeper, more invasive tumors. In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed close to or in direct contact with the tumor for a short period of time. Uses for radiation therapy Radiation therapy is an option for people after resection (surgery) of their cancer, or for those who cannot or choose not to have surgery. However, radiation therapy can be very effective for small tumors, and for tumors in areas such as the head and neck. Radiation therapy should not be used in people who have certain genetic conditions that put them at higher risk of skin cancer caused by radiation, such as basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum. It may also not be appropriate for some people who have connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma. The same area generally should not be treated with radiation more than once. When CSCC grows in a radiated area, it usually needs to be removed with surgery. However, the area often doesn’t heal as well because the tissues were weakened by the radiation. This is especially true for CSCC on the scalp. A radiation oncologist should help you determine whether this treatment is appropriate for you. Adjuvant therapy refers to therapy that is given after primary treatment to lower the risk that cancer will come back. Radiation is sometimes used as adjuvant therapy after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells, or to help prevent recurrence for patients with high-risk tumors. Side effects of radiation therapy The most common short-term side effects of radiation are skin redness, itching, mild discomfort, and feeling tired. These side effects are worse at the end of the radiation course and take several weeks to go away. Potential long-term side effects of radiation include hardening of the skin and soft tissue in the treatment area, mild change in skin color (lightening or darkening), and spider veins. More serious long-term side effects include non-healing ulcers and cataracts (for CSCC in the eye area). If you are treated with radiation, you could develop a second cancer in the treated area, but this is rare. This is more common in young patients many years (decades) later. Systemic therapy Systemic therapy is treatment with medicine(s) that travel in the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. Systemic therapies can affect both cancer cells and normal cells, and they can have side effects. They are given intravenously (through the veins) or taken by mouth as a pill. Categories of systemic therapy are described below. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill fast-growing cancer cells. Some chemotherapy medicines contain the metal platinum. Cisplatin and carboplatin are platinum chemotherapies used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other cancers. They may be given in combination with other chemotherapy drugs",

Cisplatin and carboplatin are platinum chemotherapies used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other cancers. They may be given in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. Targeted therapy Targeted therapies are medicines that can target and attack specific types of receptors on cancer cells. The targeted therapies used to treat squamous cell skin cancer are known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. EGFR is a protein found on the surface of cells that causes them to divide. Inhibiting (blocking) EGFR may keep cancer cells from growing. Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an EGFR inhibitor used to treat CSCC and other cancers. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy stimulates the activity of the immune system, which can improve the body’s ability to find and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapies used to treat CSCC and other cancers are known as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1) inhibitors. PD-1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Cemiplimab (Libtayo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are PD-1 inhibitors used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other cancers. Uses for systemic therapy Systemic therapy is not often used by itself to treat squamous cell skin cancer. It may be used in combination with radiation therapy to treat CSCC that can’t be removed using surgery. Systemic therapy alone may also be an option if both surgery and radiation therapy are not possible or were not successful. In this case, immunotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor is preferred. Side effects of systemic therapy If you are prescribed systemic therapy, you may experience side effects. The side effects of systemic therapy vary greatly depending on the medicine(s) used. Most side effects start when treatment starts and stop when it’s over, but some can occur months or even years later. Common side effects include: Tiredness and muscle fatigue Nausea/vomiting Loss of appetite Head and body aches Diarrhea or constipation More severe side effects include lung and breathing problems, damage to organs, high blood pressure, or abnormal bleeding. Longer-term side effects of systemic therapy can include other cancers, heart disease, and infertility. Side effects of systemic therapy If you are prescribed systemic therapy, you may experience some side effects. They include: Tiredness (fatigue) Nausea and vomiting Lung and breathing problems (eg, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain) Damage to major organs including the liver and kidneys Hair loss Mouth sores Body aches Rashes and other skin problems Loss of appetite Diarrhea Constipation Low blood cell counts High blood pressure Abnormal bleeding Side effects of immunotherapy known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs) Not all side effects are listed here. You can ask your care team for a more complete list and discuss any concerns you might have. More information on the side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors and on managing nausea following treatment is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Clinical trials A clinical trial is a type of medical research study. After being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. Phases Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. Treatment trials are done in phases. Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. They also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA. Phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment. Who can enroll? Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. These requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. Informed consent Clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. The research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. Take time to discuss it with family, friends, or others you trust. Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. Start the conversation Don’t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. Start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. If you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. If you have already started standard treatment, you may not be eligible for certain clinical trials. Try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. New clinical trials are always becoming available. Frequently asked questions There are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. The possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. Will I get a placebo? Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. It is",

Finding a clinical trial In the United States NCCN Cancer Centers NCCN.org/cancercenters The National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/ clinical-trials/search Worldwide The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) clinicaltrials.gov/ Need help finding a clinical trial? NCI’s Cancer Information Service (CIS) CANCER (6237) cancer.gov/contact Are clinical trials free? There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. The study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. You may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. During the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. This care is billed to—and often covered by— insurance. You are responsible for copays and any costs for this care that are not covered by your insurance. Key points Photodynamic therapy, cryotherapy, and topical therapy are treatment options for actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions). Types of surgery for squamous cell skin cancer include curettage and electrodesiccation, PDEMA/Mohs surgery, and standard surgical excision. Radiation therapy is a treatment option for people who cannot or choose not to have surgery. For the treatment of some squamous cell skin cancers, it is used after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells. Systemic therapy (eg, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) is not used often for CSCC, except when it has spread elsewhere in the body. It may be an option if surgery and radiation therapy are not possible or were not successful. Enrolling in a clinical trial is another option for treatment. Talk with your care team about seeing if you qualify for a clinical trial if one is available. 3 Local cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) 5 Risk assessment 7 Low-risk 8 High-risk or very high-risk 9 Key points Squamous cell skin cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes is known as “local”. Local disease is usually treated with surgery. The goal of treatment is to remove all of the cancer with as little damage to the surrounding skin as possible. Risk assessment After squamous cell skin cancer is confirmed, your doctor will consider several features of the cancer to determine if it is a low-, high-, or very high-risk skin cancer. This is important to know because high- or very high-risk disease is treated differently than low-risk disease. A high-risk CSCC has an increased risk of local recurrence. A very high-risk CSCC has an increased risk of local recurrence and of metastasis (spread). The risk level or category for skin cancer is usually based on the highest risk factor found. The following factors are used to determine your risk level. Location and size Squamous cell skin cancer on the head or neck is more likely to return after treatment than tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs. The following tumors are considered high risk because of their location and/or size: Tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs that are between 2 centimeters (cm) (about the size of a nickel) and 4 cm (about the size of a quarter) Any size tumor on the head, face, neck, hands, feet, shins, or sex organs The following tumors are considered very high risk because of their size: h Any tumor over 4 cm in any location Get to know your care team Keep the names and contact information for each member of your care team on hand, so you know whom to contact with questions or concerns. Tumor shape If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is well-defined, it is considered low risk. If the border isn’t well-defined and has an uneven shape, it is considered high risk. Tumor return after treatment Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned after treatment, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. All treatment types have a risk of recurrence. The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body. Any tumor that has returned after treatment is considered a high-risk squamous cell skin cancer. Tumor formed in damaged skin If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area that was previously treated with radiation therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer. This is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound, a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin. Nerve damage If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer. This is also called perineural invasion. Signs that the cancer may have invaded nerves include pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or movement, and double or blurred vision. Tumor grade The tumor grade is a rating of how fast your doctors expect the cancer to grow and spread. It is based on how different the tumor cells look compared to normal cells under a microscope. The more different they look, the higher the risk of spreading. Tumor type To diagnose squamous cell skin cancer, you likely had a small sample of tissue removed for testing (",

The more different they look, the higher the risk of spreading. Tumor type To diagnose squamous cell skin cancer, you likely had a small sample of tissue removed for testing (a skin biopsy). That tissue sample was then analyzed by a pathologist in order to determine the specific type (and subtype) of cancer. There are certain rare subtypes of squamous cell skin cancer that are more likely to return after treatment. Connective tissue in the tumor Some tumors form fibrous or connective tissue, which is a sign of a high-risk or very high-risk cancer. How deep the tumor is The deeper the tumor has invaded into the skin, the higher the risk of the cancer returning after treatment or spreading to distant sites. Cancer cells in lymph or blood vessels If there are cancer cells in the blood vessels or lymph vessels outside of the main tumor, it means that the cancer is more likely to spread to nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body. This is known as lymphovascular invasion. Weakened immune system People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of getting CSCC, and they are at higher risk of cancer returning after treatment. Examples of conditions that weaken the immune system include long-term corticosteroid use, having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, or having received an organ transplant. Low-risk Surgery is the preferred treatment for low-risk CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes. The options for surgery include: Curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E) or shave excision Standard surgical excision Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA If you are not a candidate for surgery, treatment with radiation therapy is recommended if you can have it. Curettage and electrodesiccation C&E or shave excision are recommended treatment options for low-risk, local CSCC. Usually it is considered for early, small CSCC on the surface of the skin. If the tumor ends up being deeper than expected into the skin during the procedure, a standard surgical or shave excision should be performed rather than C&E to remove deep areas of cancerous tissue. Standard surgical excision Standard surgical excision is a recommended treatment option for low-risk, local CSCC. If testing after surgery finds cancer cells in the surrounding tissue removed with the tumor, more treatment is needed. Further treatment options include: Mohs surgery or resection with PDEMA Another surgical excision Radiation therapy (if more surgery cannot be done) Mohs surgery or PDEMA Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA is a recommended treatment option for low-risk CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes.  See Part 2: Types of treatment for more detailed descriptions of these treatments. If you smoke or vape, seek help to quit If you smoke tobacco or use e-cigarettes, it is very important to quit. Smoking can limit how well cancer treatment works. Smoking greatly increases your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. It also increases your chances of developing other cancers. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most smokers. The stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. If you smoke, ask your doctor about counseling and medicines that can help you quit. For online support, try these websites: SmokeFree.gov BeTobaccoFree.gov CDC.gov/tobacco High-risk or very high-risk Surgery is the preferred treatment for high-risk or very high-risk CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes. The options for surgery include: Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA (preferred for very high-risk CSCC) Standard surgical excision If you are not a candidate for surgery, see If surgery is not an option on the next page. Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA is the preferred treatment option for very high-risk cancer that has not spread to lymph nodes. Before or during PDEMA, your doctor may consider a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). An SLNB is used to identify the first lymph nodes where cancer might have spread. The surgeon uses a harmless dye and a low-level radioactive solution to find the sentinel nodes. The nodes are then removed and tested for signs of cancer. If Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA removes the cancer, but other concerning features are noted during surgery, a discussion with different cancer doctors is recommended to determine next steps. Treatment with radiation therapy will be considered. If Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA does not remove all of the cancer, a discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended to consider next treatment options. If another surgery can be performed, this is often tried first. Otherwise, radiation therapy is recommended. In some cases, systemic therapy is used in addition to radiation. Platinum-based chemotherapy is a recommended option for use with radiation if you can have it. Enrolling in a clinical trial for systemic therapy may also be an option. If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may damage critical healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Standard surgical excision Standard surgical excision is a recommended treatment option for high-risk or very high-risk local CSCC. A wider margin (area of normal tissue around the lesion) is removed for highrisk or very high-risk CSCC. If standard surgical excision is successful at removing the cancer but other concerning features are noted during surgery, a discussion with different cancer doctors is recommended to determine next steps. Treatment with radiation therapy will be considered. If testing after surgery finds cancer in the margin",

Recommended types of surgery for local, high-risk or very high-risk CSCC include Mohs surgery/PDEMA and standard surgical excision. For high-risk or very high-risk CSCC in non-surgical candidates, treatment with radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy is an option. 4 Regional CSCC (in lymph nodes) Testing Treatment Metastatic squamous cell skin cancer Key points Squamous cell carcinoma that has spread to nearby lymph nodes is known as “regional”. The goal of testing for regional cancer will be to see how and where the cancer has spread, so your care team can determine the best treatment plan. Imaging If biopsy results confirm that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, a computed tomography (CT) scan of lymph nodes near the CSCC is recommended. The goal is to learn about the number, location, and size of the lymph nodes with cancer. More advanced imaging tests like a PET/CT, that uses special injectable agents to detect cancer, may be needed to see if cancer has spread farther than the lymph nodes, or to help plan treatment. Testing Biopsy If lymph nodes near the CSCC feel swollen or look abnormal on initial imaging tests, the next step is a biopsy. The types of biopsies used for squamous cell skin cancer are fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy. FNA is also known simply as needle biopsy. Surgical evaluation The results of testing will be considered in order to determine if you are a candidate for surgery to remove the cancerous lesion and nearby lymph nodes. Know your options It is always important to discuss with your doctor and care team about what your treatment options are, and any preferences or concerns you might have. Treatment Surgery is recommended to treat squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Surgery for regional CSCC involves excision (removal) of the cancerous lesion and nearby lymph nodes. Although surgery is preferred, it may not be an option for one or more reasons. In this case, see If surgery is not an option below for information. If surgery is very risky or might not completely remove your cancer, your doctor may suggest immunotherapy with cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo) first. It may shrink the tumor and make surgery less risky. Head and neck tumors Lymph nodes may be removed from one or both sides of the neck during surgery for head and neck tumors. The extent of surgery depends on the number, location, and size of the lymph nodes with cancer. After surgery, radiation therapy is often given to decrease the chance of the tumor returning. Systemic therapy is sometimes used in addition to radiation therapy after surgery. This may be the case if: Lymph nodes with cancer were not removed during surgery, or Cancer was found to have grown through the protective outer layer of any lymph nodes removed during surgery (called extracapsular or extranodal extension) In either",

Tumors on other areas of the body Surgery is the best way to treat tumors that have spread to other areas of the body if possible. Surgery removes the tumor and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells. This is important if there was more than one lymph node with cancer, or if cancer was found to have grown through the protective outer layer of any lymph nodes removed during surgery. If surgery is not an option If you cannot have surgery, a discussion between different cancer doctors to consider your treatment options is recommended.

If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy.  See Part 6: When treatment is over for information on monitoring and follow-up care. Metastatic squamous cell skin cancer Cancer cells can spread through blood and lymph to form tumors in other areas of the body. This is called metastasis. Squamous cell skin cancer does not metastasize often. For this reason, there is not much research on the best way to treat metastatic squamous cell skin cancer. A discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended to consider your treatment options. If surgery and/or radiation therapy cannot remove metastatic CSCC, systemic therapy is recommended. If you are eligible, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is preferred. Enrolling in a clinical trial for systemic therapy is another option. A clinical trial could involve treatment with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. If you are not eligible for an immune checkpoint inhibitor or a clinical trial, options for systemic therapy include platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Help for symptoms Radiation therapy and/or surgery may be used to treat distant tumors that are causing pain or other bothersome side effects. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a special radiation technique that may be used in some cases. It sends high doses of radiation to small areas to kill cancer cells and is typically given over 3 to 5 treatments. Key points Squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes is called “regional”. Your care team will test suspicious lymph nodes to determine how far the disease has spread. Testing could also include scans of your upper body, stomach, and pelvis to check for any metastatic disease (spread) to those areas. The best way to treat regional CSCC is with surgery to remove the tumor and nearby lymph nodes. Radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is often given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells. If surgery is not possible or not recommended, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or a combination of both may be options. If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may harm critical healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended. Although it is uncommon, squamous cell skin cancer can metastasize. Metastatic CSCC that cannot be removed with surgery and/or radiation is treated with systemic therapy. Systemic therapy options for metastatic CSCC include immunotherapy or a systemic therapy given in a clinical trial. If you are not a candidate for either of these, your doctor may recommend platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy. 5 When treatment is over Skin exams by your doctor Prevention for patients at high-risk Steps you can take Key points You’ve finished treatment. Now you may be wondering if—or when—cancer might return. Because you’ve already had squamous cell skin cancer, you are at higher risk of getting it again. You’re also at higher risk of getting other types of skin cancer. This chapter explains how you can help prevent and detect future skin cancers. Skin exams by your doctor After finishing treatment, getting regular skin exams to monitor for the return of squamous cell skin cancer is very important. These followup exams should include a complete check of the skin on your entire body, as well as the lymph nodes closest to the cancer site. You will be asked to undress and put on a paper gown or drape. Undergarments can be worn during the exam. The gown will be adjusted to allow your doctor to see different areas. How often you should be checked depends on whether the cancer was local (not in nearby lymph nodes) or regional (in nearby lymph nodes). For local CSCC, monitoring during the first 2 years after treatment is the most important. Exams should occur at least every 3 to 12 months (for patients who are low risk) or every 3 to 6 months (for patients who are high risk) during this time. If no further skin cancer develops in the first 2 years, then exams are spaced out to every 6 to 12 months (once or twice a year) for another 3 years. After that, having an exam once a year for the rest of your life is recommended by NCCN experts. For very high-risk local",

In addition, imaging tests may be used to monitor some people who have local CSCC. For regional CSCC, physical exams with skin checks should be performed every 2 to 3 months for 1 year, every 2 to 4 months for the second year, every 4 to 6 months for another 3 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for the rest of your life. For patients with regional CSCC, your doctor may want you to have CT scans on a regular basis to look for signs of cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in other parts of your body. The follow-up exam schedules for both local and regional squamous cell skin cancer are shown in Guide\nAbout CML 5 What is CML? 7 What causes CML? 7 What can you do to get the best care? Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade places. The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have CML. What is CML? Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of blood cancer. Blood is a tissue. A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste. Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding. There are 4 main components of blood—plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma. Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water. Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful. You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices. NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers. They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field. Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers. Cancer care is not the same for everyone. By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result. Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions. There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body. White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes), which include granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, fight infections. Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding. In CML, there are usually too many white blood cells (granulocytes). Sometimes, there are too few or too many platelets, as well. Chronic means this cancer worsens slowly. Granulocytes include: Neutrophils Eosinophils Basophils How are blood cells formed? Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones. Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. All types of blood cells are created from blood stem cells. At any given time, the bone marrow will have cells in various stages of development, from very young (immature) to almost fully mature. This process is called differentiation. Blood stem cells give rise to red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs), which are then released into your bloodstream as needed. The role of blood stem cells is to make cells called intermediaries that will become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These intermediaries are called progenitor cells or precursor cells. There are different types of progenitor cells: Lymphoid progenitor cells form into lymphoblasts that mature into lymphocytes. Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade places. The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Myeloid progenitor cells form into myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid blood cells. Often, in CML the very immature or most immature cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts) are referred to simply as blasts. CML is thought to arise from blood stem cells that make an increased amount of myeloid progenitor cells. However, an advanced form of CML, called blast phase CML (BP-CML), can cause an increased amount",

Often, in CML the very immature or most immature cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts) are referred to simply as blasts. CML is thought to arise from blood stem cells that make an increased amount of myeloid progenitor cells. However, an advanced form of CML, called blast phase CML (BP-CML), can cause an increased amount of lymphoid or myeloid progenitor cells. The type of blast phase cell will affect treatment in BP-CML. What causes CML? The cause of CML can be traced to a single, specific abnormal gene called BCR::ABLThis fused gene occurs when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and switch places. This creates a new, abnormal chromosome 22 that contains a small part of chromosome This new chromosome is referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and is the hallmark of CML. If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have CML. BCR::ABL1 is not found in normal blood cells. It is not passed down from birth parents to children. The BCR::ABL1 gene makes a new protein that leads to uncontrolled blood cell growth. This growth ultimately leads to CML. Treatment for CML aims to stop the activity of the BCR::ABL1 protein. Those with CML should be treated at centers experienced in this type of cancer. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. Consider seeking the opinion of a CML specialist. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care. You may not know what to ask your care team. That’s common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called Questions to ask. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care. Take the next step and keep reading to learn what is the best care for you! This book is organized into chapters on: Testing Treatment CML phases 2 Tests Test results General health tests Blood tests Fertility (all genders) Performance status Bone marrow tests Testing for CML biomarker and genetic changes Heart tests Key points Questions to ask Treatment planning starts with testing. Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat CML. This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect. Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results. Keep a list of contact information for your care team and update your primary care physician (PCP) regarding any changes. Include details about the specific type of cancer, treatment, and dates on your contact list. Ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency. Test results Results from blood tests and possible biopsy will be used to determine your treatment plan. Treatment will be based on these findings. It is important you understand what these tests mean. Ask questions about your test results. Online patient portals are one way to access your test results. Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment. Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support. These can be different people for different tasks or change over time. Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible, or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments. Write down questions and ask a friend or family member to take notes. Caregivers should ask questions, too. Tests used to diagnose CML can be found in Guide\nLung cancer basics What is NSCLC? What is early and locally advanced NSCLC? What’s the best treatment? Key points If you’re reading this, you or someone you care for might have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It’s the most common type of lung cancer. In this chapter, you’ll learn what this type of cancer is and what it means if it’s early or locally advanced. What is NSCLC? Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of lung cancer. Another type of lung cancer is small cell lung cancer, but it is a different cancer covered in another book. Lung cancer cells grow out of control. They don’t die when they should and make many new cancer cells, which become tumors. Lung cancer cells also don’t stay in place. They can break away from a tumor, spread outside the lung, and form more tumors. NSCLC is a type of lung carcinoma Almost all lung cancers are carcinomas (karsin-OH-mas). Lung carcinomas form from cells that line the airways of the lungs. The airways inside the lungs are the bronchi, bronchioli, and alveoli. NSCLC is the most common lung carcinoma. Other lung carcinomas are neuroendocrine tumors. Information on lung neuroendocrine tumors can be found at Airways of the lungs The air you breathe moves through a series of airways. It travels down your throat and through your windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into two airways called bronchi. Inside the lung, each bronchus divides into smaller airways called the bronchioli. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli. Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli.

Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli. NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. There are several types of NSCLC Each type of NSCLC forms from a particular kind of cell. Below are common types of NSCLC: Adenocarcinoma (A-deh-noh-KAR-sihNOH-muh) often forms from cells that line the alveoli and make mucus. This is the most common type of NSCLC. Large cell carcinoma forms from any of the large cells that are found throughout the airways. Squamous cell carcinoma (squaymous) forms from cells that line the bronchi. What is early and locally advanced NSCLC? Early and locally advanced lung cancers have not spread to the tissue lining around the lung or to other organs. The difference between early and locally advanced cancer is mainly based on the cancer stage. Cancer stages 1, 2, and 3 A cancer stage describes the extent of lung cancer in the body. The main stages of NCCN Guidelines for Patients® Early and Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024 Cancers that have spread to the lungs are not lung cancers. For example, stomach cancer that has spread to the lungs is still stomach cancer. lung cancer are often written with Roman numerals—stages I (1), II (2), III (3), and IV (4). We will be listing stages as 1, 2, 3, and 4 to make the stages easier to read. At diagnosis, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 cancers have grown from the airway into lung tissue. Some have spread to nearby diseasefighting structures called lymph nodes. Stage 1 is early NSCLC. In general, stage 2 and stage 3 are considered locally advanced. Cancer stages and metastasis Some early and locally advanced cancers spread to the tissue lining around the lung or to other organs after diagnosis and then are called metastatic cancer. Stage 4 cancer is metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis. Information about metastatic NSCLC is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. What’s the best treatment? There’s no single treatment for NSCLC that’s best for everyone. The best treatment is the treatment that’s right for you. The following chapters explain expert recommendations that are based on the latest research and current practices at leading cancer centers. Often, multiple treatments are used to get the best results Some people with early or locally advanced NSCLC have surgery to remove cancer from the body. Other types of cancer treatment are used with surgery to improve results. Read Chapter 5 to learn more about treatment with surgery. If you can’t have surgery, there are other good options. Some early cancers are treated with radiation therapy, which is explained in Chapter Other cancers are treated with 2 types of treatments called chemoradiation. Chemoradiation is discussed in Chapter Supportive care addresses the challenges of cancer Supportive care has been shown to extend and enhance life for people with lung cancer. Tell your care team about your symptoms and other needs to get the best supportive care for you. More information on supportive care can be found throughout this book. Clinical trials offer hope to all people with lung cancer Clinical trials are a type of health research that tests new ways of fighting cancer. Ask your care team if there is a clinical trial that is a good fit for you. Learn more about clinical trials in Chapter Advocate for yourself You are an important member of your cancer care team. Discuss the recommendations in this book with your team. Together, you can make a care plan that’s best for you. There is a list of suggested questions in Chapter 9 to ask your team. You’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making decisions with your team. Key points Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a cancer of lung cells. Cancers that spread to the lungs are not lung cancer. Early and locally advanced NSCLCs are cancers that have grown from the airways into lung tissue, and some have spread to lymph nodes. Treatment for NSCLC varies based on what is best for each person. When possible, surgery is used for primary treatment. 2 Lung nodules Lung nodule experts Risk for lung cancer Signs of lung cancer Planning follow-up care Types of follow-up care Follow-up of solid nodules Follow-up of subsolid nodules Planning to remove tissue Removing samples for cancer testing Confirming lung cancer Key points Many people have small masses of tissue in their lungs, called nodules. A nodule may have been found in your lung by chance. This chapter discusses how experts decide if this nodule is cancer. Lung nodule experts Most lung nodules are not cancer, but some are. Nodules can be caused by cancer, infections, scar tissue, and other health conditions. When a nodule found by chance seems to be cancer, it takes a team of experts to decide the best course of care. Your care team should consist of members from different fields of medicine, including the following board-certified experts: h A pulmonologist is a doctor who’s an expert in lung diseases. A thoracic radiologist is a doctor who’s an expert in imaging of the chest. Imaging takes pictures of the inside of the body. h A thoracic surgeon is a doctor who is an expert in operations within the chest. To decide if a nodule is cancer, your team will do the following",

To decide if a nodule is cancer, your team will do the following: Assess your risk for lung cancer. Review lung images and request more imaging if there may be cancer. Perform a procedure called a biopsy, if needed. Lung nodule A lung nodule is a small mass of tissue in the lung. Many people have lung nodules. Most are not cancer. When nodules are found by imaging, you may receive more scans to assess if the nodule is cancer. If the nodule is unlikely cancer, your team may refer you for lung cancer screening. Lung cancer screening is for people at high risk for lung cancer. Information on lung cancer screening is available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Risk for lung cancer Anyone can get lung cancer, but some people are more at risk. A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of lung cancer. Risk factors for lung cancer are listed in Guide Some people with many risk factors never get lung cancer. Some people with no risk factors do get lung cancer. Experts are still learning why one person gets lung cancer and another does not. Tobacco smoke The biggest risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco. There are more than 50 compounds in tobacco smoke known to cause cancer. The risk grows the more times a person smokes and the longer they smoke. Exposure to second-hand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by another person and the smoke from the burning end of tobacco products. Researchers are studying ways to prevent lung cancer caused by smoking. Treatments to prevent cancer are called chemopreventive agents. Ask your care team if there is a clinical trial on preventing lung cancer that you could join. Cancer-causing agents You are more likely to get lung cancer, especially if you smoke, after exposure to: Radon Asbestos Arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, and nickel Coal smoke, soot, silica, and diesel fumes Air pollution by fine particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide\nLung cancer screening basics The lungs Lung cancer Early detection Key points Lung cancer starts in the cells of the lungs. For those at risk of developing lung cancer, regular screening can help find lung cancer at its earliest, most treatable stages. The lungs The lungs are a pair of organs located in the chest. The lungs move important gases in and out of the blood. You breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide (a gas made by cells) from the body. The lungs have sections called lobes. The left lung has 2 lobes and the right lung has 3 lobes. A thin layer of tissue surrounds the lungs called the pleural membrane. This membrane protects the lungs. Two large breathing tubes, called bronchi, connect the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs. There is one tube, called a bronchus, for each lung. Inside the lungs are small tubes (bronchioles) and small air sacs (alveoli). The respiratory system The air you breathe moves through a series of airways. It travels down your throat and through your windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into 2 airways called bronchi. Inside the lung, each bronchus branches off into the parts of the lung called lobes. The right lung has 3 lobes and the left lung has 2 lobes. The bronchi divide into smaller airways called the bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli. From here, oxygen is transferred into your blood. Lung cancer Almost all lung cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. Lung carcinomas start in the cells that line the airways of the lungs. The airways of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles, and alveoli. There are different types of lung carcinoma. The main types are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Other types of cancer can spread to the lungs, such as breast cancer. Breast cancer that has spread to the lungs is still called breast cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a group of cancers that are the most common type of lung cancer. NSCLC can be broken down into subtypes by looking at the cancer cells under a microscope. This is called histology. Adenocarcinoma starts in the mucusmaking cells that line the alveoli (small air sacs). This is the most common subtype. About 4 out of 10 lung cancers are adenocarcinomas. This is the most common type of lung cancer seen in those who don’t smoke or who don’t have a history of smoking. More information on NSCLC and SCLC is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in the flat cells that line the inside of the airways (bronchi) in the lungs. About 3 out of 10 lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma starts in large cells that can grow anywhere in the lungs. This accounts for 5 out of 10 NSCLCs. Small cell lung cancer Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-dividing cancer of the neuroendocrine cells. Under a microscope, the cancer cells look small and oval- or oat-shaped. It is the second",

Early detection The goal of lung cancer screening is to find lung cancer at an early stage, even before there are any symptoms. This is when treatment will be most successful. Early detection of lung cancer helps prevent death. Together, you and your health care provider should discuss if screening is right for you. Key points The lungs are a pair of organs that move important gases in and out of the blood. Lung cancer starts in the cells that line the lungs. Most lung cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. Lung carcinomas start in the cells that line the airways of the lungs. The airways of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles, and alveoli. Lung cancer screening aims to find cancer early and before symptoms start. Lung cancer found earlier is more likely to be treated successfully. Lung cancer screening is not recommended for everyone. Screening is for those at risk for developing lung cancer. Ask your health care provider if you qualify for lung cancer screening. Your wishes are always important. Talk to your health care provider and make your wishes known. 2 Risk assessment Risk factors Find out your level of risk Care team Start before you have symptoms Key points Risk is your chance of developing lung cancer. Some people are more likely than others to develop lung cancer. Anything that increases your chances of developing lung cancer is called a risk factor. Lung cancer screening is based on your risk factors described in this chapter. See your health care provider (HCP) regularly for checkups and cancer screenings, which may include screenings for skin, breast, prostate cancer, and other types of cancer. You might be asked to see your HCP more than every year based on your risk factors for developing lung cancer. As your family health history changes, it is important to keep your HCP updated. Risk factors Risk is your chance of developing lung cancer. Everyone has some risk for developing lung cancer. However, some people are at increased risk. Risk factors can be activities that people do, things in the environment, or traits passed down from biological parents to children through genes. Genes are a set of instructions that tell new cells what to become (for example, lung, heart, and skin) and what to do (make hormones, absorb nutrients, and kill germs). Known risk factors for lung cancer are listed in Guide\nLung cancer basics What is lung cancer? What are the causes and risk factors? What are the symptoms of SCLC? What's the treatment for SCLC? Key points Small cell lung cancer forms from cells that line the inner airways of the lungs. It’s a cancer that can be aggressive and grows fast. This chapter gives you the basics of small cell lung cancer. What is lung cancer? The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. They deliver oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The transfer of these gases in and out of the body is called respiration. Lung cancers form from cells that line the airways of the lungs. The lungs' airways are called the bronchus, bronchioli, and alveoli. Cancer cells don’t behave like normal cells. They break the rules of cell growth. Cancer cells make many new cancer cells. They also do not die when they should. This overgrowth of cancer cells becomes a mass of tissue called a tumor. Cancer cells grow out of control. They can grow through the airway and into the lung tissue. They can grow through the lung wall and invade other body parts. Cancer cells can break away from a tumor and spread. They can enter the bloodstream or a fluid called lymph and spread to other places. This out-of-control cell growth can harm the body. Cancer cells crowd out and overwhelm normal cells. Without enough normal cells, cancer cells can cause organs to stop working. Scientists have learned a great deal about cancer. As a result, today’s treatments work Small cell lung cancer cells appear small and blue when viewed with a microscope. better than treatments in the past. Also, many people with cancer have more than one treatment option. The two most common types of lung cancer are: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), further divided into: • Adenocarcinoma • Squamous cell carcinoma • Adenosquamous carcinoma • Large cell carcinoma • Sarcomatoid carcinoma Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), further divided into: • Small cell carcinoma • Combined (small and non-small) cell lung carcinoma The names of the cancers refer to their appearance under a microscope. When viewed with a microscope, SCLCs appear small and blue. Sometimes lung tumors contain both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer cells. These are called combined (small and non-small) cell lung carcinomas and are usually treated like small cell lung cancer. SCLC is much less common than NSCLC. It is the focus of this book. NCCN has a two-part book series on NSCLC, found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. What are the causes and risk factors? Smoking cigarettes is the main cause of SCLC. Almost everyone with SCLC smokes or has smoked. Many people with SCLC have regularly smoked more than a pack a day. Exposure to second-hand smoke also increases the risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by another person and the smoke from combustible tobacco products.",

Almost everyone with SCLC smokes or has smoked. Many people with SCLC have regularly smoked more than a pack a day. Exposure to second-hand smoke also increases the risk of lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by another person and the smoke from combustible tobacco products. Although rare in Western countries, there are occasions where people with no smoking history develop this disease. There are other unknown causes of SCLC. Researchers are still learning why some people who smoke never get lung cancer and others who have never smoked do. A person’s chances of getting SCLC are higher in the following situations: Over 70 years of age Prior radiation therapy to the chest Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals (also known as carcinogens), such as radon and asbestos If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do smoke, quit. New lung tumors are less likely to develop after quitting smoking. Nicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to stop. The stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. There is help. Ask your health care providers about counseling and medicines to help you quit. What are the symptoms of SCLC? SCLC can cause many types of symptoms. The symptoms depend on where the lung tumor has grown to or spread. SCLC can prevent the lungs from getting the air they need. Some people also have symptoms from paraneoplastic syndromes, which are caused by an abnormal body response to lung cancer. Some symptoms caused by SCLC are listed in Guide SCLC is often found when it’s causing symptoms or routine blood tests are abnormal. Less often, it’s found in x-rays or CT scans before symptoms start. Unlike other lung cancers, it’s difficult to detect SCLC early because it grows more quickly. Airways of the lungs Air moves through your body in a series of airways. It travels down your throat and through the windpipe (trachea). The windpipe splits into 2 airways called bronchi. Inside the lung, each bronchus branches off into the parts of the lung, called lobes. The right lung has 3 lobes, and the left lung has 2 lobes. The bronchi divide into smaller airways called the bronchioli. At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli. Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli. Your primary care provider may be the first to suspect that you have lung cancer. You will need to see specialists to determine if you have cancer. Your assessment team may include the following board-certified experts: Thoracic radiologist Interventional radiologist Pulmonologist Thoracic surgeon Medical oncologist Radiation oncologist To confirm that you have cancer, you’ll need testing of your body tissue or fluid. Small samples will be removed from your body during a procedure called a biopsy.\nThe esophagus Parts of the esophagus Esophageal cancer How cancer spreads Key points The esophagus is a long, muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach. Esophageal cancer starts when abnormal cells grow out of control in the layers of the esophagus inner lining. The esophagus The esophagus is located behind the trachea (windpipe) and in front of the spine. It is part of the digestive system. The digestive system transports and breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste from the body. It includes the esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, rectum, and anus. Food and drink enter the mouth and move through the esophagus into the stomach. When you swallow, small contractions, called peristalsis, along with gravity and pressure, move food down the esophagus and into the stomach. Except during the act of swallowing, the esophagus is normally empty. The esophagus is about 10 inches long and about 1 inch wide. It has two sphincters, circular muscles that normally remain closed except during the act of swallowing. One sphincter is located at the top of the esophagus and the other at the bottom, between the esophagus and the stomach. The digestive tract The digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the digestive system. Food enters the mouth and passes through the esophagus into the stomach. After being broken down into a liquid, food enters the small intestine. The large intestine prepares unused food to be moved out of the body. Parts of the esophagus Esophagus wall The esophagus wall contains 4 layers: Mucosa – inner membrane that is in contact with food. It has 3 parts: Epithelium – innermost lining and is normally made up of flat, thin cells called squamous cells Lamina propria – thin layer of connective tissue under the epithelium Muscularis mucosa - very thin layer of muscle under the lamina propria Submucosa – layer of connective tissue just below the mucosa that contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels. In some parts of the esophagus, this layer also includes glands that secrete mucus. Muscularis propria – thick layer of muscle under the submucosa. It contracts in a coordinated way to push food down the esophagus from the throat to the stomach (peristalsis). Tunica adventitia – outermost layer, made of connective tissue Upper esophagus The upper part of the esophagus is made of striated muscle. Striated muscle generates force and contracts. It is under your control (voluntary). Middle esophagus The middle part of the esophagus is a mixture of striated and smooth muscle. Lower esophagus The lower part of the esophagus consists only of smooth muscle. Smooth muscle is not under your control. It is",

Lower esophagus The lower part of the esophagus consists only of smooth muscle. Smooth muscle is not under your control. It is involuntary, like a reflex. Esophagogastric junction The esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is the place where the stomach and the esophagus meet, found just beneath the diaphragm. It is also called the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). It separates the contents of the esophagus from the contents of the stomach (acid). Esophageal cancer Cancer of the esophagus (or esophageal cancer) starts when cells in the epithelium of the esophagus begin to grow out of control. There are 2 types of esophageal cancer: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) starts in the thin, flat cells found in the inner lining of the esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is often found in the upper and middle esophagus but can occur in the lower esophagus as well. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) starts in the mucus-making cells of the inner lining of the esophagus. Adenocarcinomas are often found in the lower esophagus but can occur in the middle esophagus as well. Today, most esophageal cancers in North America and Western Europe are adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa. Treatment is based on the type and location of esophageal cancer, in addition to the stage of the tumor (where it is in the body). Some tumors that start in the stomach and cross over into the area between the esophagus and stomach (esophagogastric junction) are treated as esophageal cancers and not as stomach cancers. However, this depends on the exact location of the tumor. Siewert types used as part of cancer staging describe where the tumor is relative to the esophagus and stomach. Barrett esophagus In Barrett esophagus (BE), the squamous cells that line the lower part of the esophagus have changed or been replaced with abnormal cells as a result of chronic reflux. Those with Barrett esophagus are at risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. How cancer spreads Esophageal cancer usually starts in the innermost layer (mucosa) and grows outward through and along the layers of the esophagus wall. Cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes, veins, arteries, and organs such as the liver, pancreas, lung, and spleen. It might also grow into nearby lymphatic or blood vessels, and from there spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. Through your cancer care, you might find measurements using the metric system (centimeters, millimeters, etc.). That is because your care team uses the metric system to measure many aspects of treatment. Esophageal cancers tend to develop slowly over many years. Before cancer develops, precancerous changes often occur in the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus. Since these early changes rarely cause symptoms, they often go undetected. Stages of esophageal cancer can be grouped into 3 main categories, depending on how far the cancer has spread. Early-stage cancer has not grown beyond the inside of the esophagus. The tumor may be very small (2 centimeters or less, which is about the size of a peanut) and is not in any lymph nodes. Locoregional or locally advanced cancer has invaded the esophagus wall and/or spread to the lymph nodes or organs near or in direct contact with the esophagus. Metastatic cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The most common metastatic sites are the liver, distant lymph nodes, lung, bone, and brain. Key points Most esophageal cancers start in cells that line the inside of the esophagus and secrete mucus. These esophageal cancers are called adenocarcinomas. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma starts in the thin, flat cells found in the inner lining of the esophagus. The esophagus wall is made up of 4 main layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and tunica adventitia. Esophageal cancers tend to develop slowly over many years. Before cancer develops, pre-cancerous changes often occur in the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus. Early-stage esophageal cancer is contained in the esophagus. The tumor is often small and is not in any lymph nodes. Locoregional or locally advanced esophageal cancer has invaded other layers of the esophagus wall and/or spread to the lymph nodes or organs near or in direct contact with the esophagus. Cancer can spread to distant parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system. This is called metastatic esophageal cancer. Distant metastases could be in the liver, distant lymph nodes, and lung. 2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer Test results General health tests Nutritional assessment Blood tests Imaging tests Endoscopy procedures Biopsy Biomarker testing Genetic risk testing Performance status Key points Treatment planning starts with testing.

Get to know your care team and help them get to know you. Get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. Organize your papers. Create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. You can do the same on your computer. Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. Add it to your phone. Hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. Keep your primary care physician informed of changes to this list. In your contact list, include information on your exact type of cancer, as well as any treatments and the date each treatment started. Set up an online patient portal (MyChart or health record account) if it’s available, which can help you track your appointments and communicate with your care team. Remember, many times, the portal messages are not immediately seen by a nurse or physician. Be sure to ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency.

Types of Hodgkin lymphoma 8 What can you do to get the best care? Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable cancer that usually starts in lymph nodes in the upper body. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 to 30, or after age What is lymphoma? Lymphoma is cancer that begins when white blood cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. Lymphomas are described as either Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a large and varied group of cancers. When viewed under a microscope, Hodgkin lymphoma cells look different than other lymphomas. The lymphocytes are abnormally large and may have more than one nucleus. These oversized lymphocytes are called ReedSternberg cells. The focus of this resource is Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. Information on Hodgkin lymphoma in children and adolescents is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. What is the lymphatic system? The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. It helps your body fight infection and disease. The tissues and organs that make up the lymphatic system are described next.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. It helps your body fight infection and disease. The tissues and organs that make up the lymphatic system are described next. They are made mostly of lymphocytes. There are other types of white blood cells, but lymphocytes are the most important to understanding Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymph and lymphatic vessels There is a super-highway of ducts running through your body. These ducts are called lymphatic vessels. Much like how blood vessels transport blood, lymphatic vessels transport lymph. Lymph is a clear fluid that carries infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes) throughout the body. It is also called lymphatic fluid. Lymph nodes While lymph travels throughout your body in lymphatic vessels, it passes through hundreds of small bean-shaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes catch and filter out foreign particles and harmful cells, including cancer cells. Lymph nodes can’t usually be seen or felt. The highest numbers of lymph nodes are found in the neck, groin, and armpits. Spleen The spleen is the largest organ of the lymphatic system. It is about 4 inches long and shaped like a fist. It makes lymphocytes and plays an important role in blood filtration and storage. Lymphatic system There are hundreds of small bean-shaped structures, called lymph nodes, throughout the human body. They catch and filter out foreign particles and harmful cells, including cancer cells. Bone marrow Most bones have soft, spongy tissue in the center called bone marrow. This is where new blood cells are made. Thymus After being made in bone marrow, lymphocytes travel to the thymus. The thymus is a small organ in the upper chest. Here lymphocytes develop into T lymphocytes (T cells), one of the two main types of lymphocytes. The tonsils Tonsils are small masses of lymph tissue found at the back of the throat. They help trap disease-causing germs that enter through you nose or mouth. Types of Hodgkin lymphoma There are 2 types of Hodgkin lymphoma, described next. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma Most people with Hodgkin lymphoma have classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). CHL can be recognized by large lymphocytes called ReedSternberg cells. While there are different subtypes of CHL, the same care is recommended for all of them. NLPHL While CHL is known for Reed-Sternberg cells, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is known for popcornshaped cells. This rare form of Hodgkin lymphoma usually grows slowly, but in rare cases behaves aggressively. Over time, it can transform into one of several types of fast-growing cancer, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care. You may not know what to ask your care team. That’s common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called Questions to ask. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care. Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful. You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers. They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field. Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers. Cancer care is not the same for everyone. By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result. Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions. 2 Testing for Hodgkin lymphoma Biopsy and lab testing Health history and physical exam Blood tests Imaging tests Heart and lung tests Other testing and care Key points Questions to ask This chapter explains how Hodgkin lymphoma is identified (diagnosed). Other testing and care you may have before treatment is described. Biopsy and lab testing The best way to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma is to have 1 or more whole lymph nodes removed and tested. This is called an excisional lymph node biopsy. While an excisional biopsy is preferred, a core needle biopsy may be done in some cases. In this method, a doctor uses a wide needle to remove a sample of tissue from a lymph node, but doesn’t remove the entire node.

Types of FL Key points Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a slow-growing (indolent) nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHLs develop from B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes form clusters (follicles) in the lymph nodes and sometimes other tissues. Lymphatic system Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) begins in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic or lymph system is a major part of the body’s immune system. It is a germ- and cancer-fighting network of tissues and organs that includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels are a network of thin tubes that carry lymphatic fluid (lymph) and white blood cells into all the tissues of the body. White blood cells, such as lymphocytes cells, help fight infection and other diseases. Lymphatic system The lymphatic or lymph system is part of the immune system. It includes lymph vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. As lymph travels throughout your body, it passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes make immune cells that help the body fight infection. They also filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and cancer cells. Lymphocytes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer of lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that helps fight and prevent infection. Lymphocytes are found in blood and lymph tissue, and every organ in the body. Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels and lymph nodes. Lymphocytes normally grow in response to infection or inflammation. When they grow on their own without proper regulation, they can develop into lymphoma. Germinal centers Follicular lymphoma (FL) starts in the temporary germinal centers (GCs) of lymph nodes. These germinal centers are short-lived structures that form in response to infection or inflammation. When B cells within germinal centers grow out of control, it can form FL. There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies. An antibody is a protein that specifically targets infections or cancer cells and recruits other parts of the immune system. T lymphocytes or T cells help fight infections, cancer, and control immune responses. Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor cells or virus-infected cells. Follicular lymphoma starts in mature B cells. Follicular lymphoma Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is a slow-dividing, slow-growing B-cell lymphoma that typically forms tumors in lymph nodes. However, FL can form tumors in other parts of the body such as the bone marrow. This is called extranodal (outside of the lymph node) disease. Not everyone with FL needs treatment right away. How does FL develop? In lymph nodes, temporary germinal centers (GCs) form in response to an immune stressor such as infection or inflammation. This is normal. But, when cells within germinal centers grow without proper regulation, it can develop into FL. In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes group together to form clusters (follicles) in the lymph nodes. It might be helpful to know that these short-lived germinal centers are different than those found in some subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There are 2 zones in the germinal center: light and dark. B cells in the light zone are called centrocytes. They are smaller, less in number, and divide less than B cells in the dark zone. B cells within the dark zone are called centroblasts. They are larger than the cells in the light zone and reproduce (divide) more. The types of cells found in your FL help determine the grade, which then determines the stage. The stage tells if your cancer should be treated as classic FL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed FL, or individualized. Grading The types of cells found in your FL help determine the grade. Grades include 1, 2, 3A, and 3B. Grade 3B contains only centroblasts (large cells), while the other grades contain mixtures of centrocytes (small cells) and centroblasts (large cells). The more centroblasts, the higher the grade. The grade helps tell how your lymphoma should be treated. Two different organizations categorize FL based on grade. In the 2022 World Health Organization classification (WHO5), follicular lymphoma grades 1, 2, and 3A are termed classic FL (cFL). International Consensus classification (ICC) groups grades 1 and 2 as cFL. This book follows the ICC classification system. h FL grade 1 and 2 are treated as classic FL according to the ICC. h Grade 3A might be treated as classic FL or DLBCL depending on the cancer center and the types of cells found with testing",

FL grade 3B (FL3B) called follicular large B cell lymphoma in the WHO5 is rare. It is treated as DLBCL. Types of FL The following types of FL are described in this book. Classic FL As mentioned on the previous page, classic FL (cFL) is grade 1 or Almost everyone with FL has a chromosome translocation or has excess levels of the BCL2 protein in their tumor. A chromosome translocation is the switching of part of one chromosome with another chromosome within the lymphoma cells. Uncommon FL When FL has uncommon pathologic (disease) features or is t(14;18)-negative, it might be called uncommon FL (uFL). It is treated as classic FL in this book. Pediatric-type FL Pediatric-type FL (PTFL) usually occurs in children but can also occur in adults. Usually, only one lymph node is enlarged in the head and neck region and there might be no symptoms. Transformed FL FL can transform into a more aggressive lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This means your slowgrowing FL has turned into a large-cell, fastgrowing lymphoma. Transformed FL can occur before, during, or after treatment. In DLBCL, tumors are commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other tissues and organs.

This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect. Follicular lymphoma (FL) might be found because of swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen. Swollen lymph nodes can occur anywhere in the body but are most often in the neck, armpit, and groin area and in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on imaging scans. FL symptoms can include fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. These symptoms are referred to as B symptoms. Not everyone has the same symptoms. Test results Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat FL. Results from blood tests, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies will be used to guide your treatment plan. It is important you understand what these tests mean. Ask questions about your test results. Online patient portals are one way to access your test results, but may also contain communication between members of your health care team and other information that might need explaining. Please wait to discuss all test results with your doctor or health care team so you have a complete and accurate understanding of the results. Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment. Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support. These can be different people for different tasks or change over time. Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible, or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits. Don't hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments. Write down questions and ask a friend or family member to take notes. Caregivers should ask questions, too. Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results. Keep a list of contact information for your care team and update your primary care physician (PCP) regarding any changes. Include details about the specific type of cancer, treatment, and dates in your contact list. Set up a MyChart or health record account if it’s available, which can help you track your appointments and communicate with your care team. In many places the MyChart or portal messages are not immediately seen by a nurse or physician, so ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency.

A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you.\nMouth cancer basics The mouth Head and neck cancer Mouth cancer Key points Mouth or oral cavity cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lips, the front two-thirds of the tongue, the gums, the lining inside the cheeks and lips, the floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue, the hard palate (bony top of the mouth), the bony ridges that hold the sockets of the teeth, and the small area of the gum behind the wisdom teeth. The mouth, or oral cavity, is the first part of the digestive and respiratory (breathing) systems. The lips, cheeks, palate, teeth, and tongue make up the mouth. The mouth helps us breathe, talk, chew, taste, swallow, eat, and drink. The cheeks and lips hold food in the mouth and help to form and sound words. Parts of the mouth The 2 main functions of the mouth are eating and speaking. The mouth is also known as the oral cavity or the buccal cavity. Some important structures of the mouth: Hard palate is the hard, bony part of the roof of the mouth. The mouth Tongue is a muscular organ in your mouth that aids in chewing, speaking, and breathing. Lips surround the opening of the mouth. Buccal (oral) mucosa is the lining inside the cheeks and inside where the lips touch the teeth. Alveolar ridge is the bony, raised area of the upper (maxilla) and lower (mandible) jaw that holds the sockets of the teeth. Gums (gingiva) surround the base of the teeth and help keep them in place. Retromolar trigone is the small area behind the wisdom teeth. Oral mucosa The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane lining the inside of the mouth and lips. It is made up of 2 layers. Epithelium – The surface layer containing stratified squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells. Lamina propria – The bottom layer of connective tissue. A tumor can grow through the layers of the oral mucosa. A measure of how deep the tumor has grown is called depth of invasion (DOI). Depending on the region of the mouth, the epithelium may be nonkeratinized or keratinized. Nonkeratinized squamous epithelium covers the soft palate, inner lips, inner cheeks, the floor of the mouth, and area underneath the tongue. Keratinized squamous epithelium is present on rough surfaces caused by chewing such as the gums (gingiva) and hard palate as well as the top of the tongue. Head and neck cancer Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Cancer is named and treated based on the tumor location or where the cancer started. Cancer can occur in the Mouth (oral cavity), Middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), Upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), Voice box (larynx), or Lower part of the throat near the voice box (hypopharynx). More information on nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and throat (oropharyngeal) cancer can be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. It is strongly recommended, when possible, for those with head and neck cancers to be treated at a high-volume center or hospital that has experience in their type of cancer. Mouth cancer Cancer that occurs on the inside of the mouth is also called oral cancer or oral cavity cancer. Mouth cancer is one of several types of cancers grouped into a category called head and neck cancers. Mouth cancer and other head and neck cancers are often treated similarly. Mouth cancer starts in the squamous cells that form the surface lining of the mouth. Normally, these are thin, flat cells and are similar to the top layer of skin and surface lining some other parts of the body such as the lungs and esophagus. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of mouth cancer and is the focus of this book. Mouth cancer can develop in the parts that make up the mouth such as: Lips (mucosal lip) Gums (gingiva) Lining inside the cheeks and lips (buccal mucosa) Front two-thirds of the tongue Roof of the mouth (hard palate) Bony, raised areas that hold the teeth sockets (alveolar ridge) h Floor of the mouth (under the tongue) Small area of the gum behind the wisdom teeth (retromolar trigone) Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip is not included in this book. The vermillion lip is the area where the skin and the lip meet on the outside of the mouth. Information for treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the vermilion lip can be found in NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Squamous Cell Skin Cancer at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Key points Mouth cancer refers to cancer that develops in any of the parts that make up the mouth (oral cavity). Mouth cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Cancer treatment is based on the tumor location and cancer stage. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type",

This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. Test results Results from imaging studies and biopsy will be used to determine your cancer stage treatment plan. Treatment will be based on these findings. It is important you understand what these tests mean. Ask questions and keep copies of your test results. Online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. Please discuss your results with your health care provider. Keep these things in mind: Choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. Write down questions and take notes during appointments. Don’t be afraid to ask your care team questions. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you. Get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. Organize your papers. Create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. You can do the same on your computer. Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. Add it to your phone. Hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. Keep your primary care physician (PCP) informed of changes to this list. You are Take care of yourself. This is a stressful time. Seek out support groups at your local hospital, through social media, or from those listed in the back of this book. Look to friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers for social support. encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop. They are great partners in your care. In your contact list, include information on the exact type of cancer you have, as well as any treatments you've received and the date each treatment started. Set up a “MyChart” or health record account if it’s available, which will help you track your appointments and communicate with your care team. General health tests Some general health tests are described next. Medical history A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. Family history In general, head and neck cancers are not inherited from your biological parents. However, some cancers and other diseases can run in families. Your care team will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were Guide 1 Tests for treatment planning Medical history, tobacco and alcohol use history, and physical exam, including complete head and neck exam. Mirror and fiberoptic exam if needed. Screen for depression. Biopsy As needed: • Chest CT (with or without contrast) • CT with contrast and/or MRI with and without contrast of primary tumor and neck • FDG-PET/CT • Endoscopy with examination under anesthesia (EUA) • Dental exam with x-ray (Panorex) or CT without contrast • Nutrition, speech, and swallowing evaluation, and hearing test (audiogram) • Help to quit smoking • Fertility counseling • Screening for hepatitis B diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing. Tobacco and alcohol use history Tobacco and alcohol use are known risk factors for developing head and neck cancer and can limit how well treatment works. It can affect survival. You will be asked about your tobacco and alcohol use history and asked to avoid tobacco and limit alcohol use during treatment. Speak to your care team if you have any questions or concerns. Physical exam During a physical exam, your health care provider may: Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate Check your height and weight Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. h Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin.

Complete head and neck exam A physical exam will include the head and neck. Since some parts of the mouth and throat are not easy to see when you open your mouth, a health care provider might feel (palpate) your oral cavity and use a special mirror or fiberoptic scope to look at these areas. Dental exam It is important to tell your dentist about your head and neck cancer and to have regular dental cleanings and checkups. Head and neck cancer and its treatment can affect the health of your jaw, teeth, and gums. If you need any dental work or procedures, it might be recommended before starting certain treatments. Distress screening It is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. There are services and people who can help you. Support and counseling are available. Many treatment teams include mind and body therapists who can help. Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be stressful and may cause further distress. Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. It can affect how you feel, think, and act. Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. Your treatment team will screen your level of distress. This is part of your cancer care. Your diagnosis of cancer may affect your family or loved ones. They may feel some degree of anxiety or depression. They can talk to the social worker and seek help, too. Endocrine tests Radiation therapy to the head and neck can affect endocrine (hormone) glands found in the head and neck, such as thyroid and pituitary glands. Therefore, blood tests to look at thyroid endocrine levels might be done before and/or after treatment. Hearing test A hearing test shows if there is any hearing loss, and if so, the type of hearing loss, how severe it is, and what might have caused it. An audiogram is a graph showing the results of a pure-tone hearing test. Tumors in the head and neck can affect hearing. Treatment of head and neck tumors can also affect hearing. Nutrition assessment You might meet with a nutrition expert before starting treatment. A nutritionist or dietitian can suggest the best foods and fluids for you. It is important that you receive adequate and sustained nutrition before you start treatment. Speech and swallowing assessment You might visit with a speech or swallowing therapist who will test your ability to swallow and speak before and after treatment. Performance status Performance status (PS) is a person’s general level of fitness and ability to perform daily self-care tasks. Your state of general health will be rated using a PS scale called Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PS is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences about treatment are always important. Fertility (all genders) Treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. If you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. To preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. Those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. Fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren’t really sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. More information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults is available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Changes in fertility Treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. This loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. Talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. Preventing pregnancy during treatment Preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. Hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and barrier methods. Types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. Those with ovaries Those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. Cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. Therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. Menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your “period” may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 35 years of age and under. It is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. Therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. Consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. Those with testicles Cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. Therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms to prevent pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment.

Create a medical binder A medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. Make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. It will be helpful when getting a second opinion. Choose a binder that meets your needs. Consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. Create folders for insurance forms, test types (ie, blood, imaging, pathology, radiology, genetics), treatments, and procedures. Organize items in the folder by date. Use online patient portals to view your test results and other records. Download or print the records to add to your binder. Add a section for questions and to take notes. Bring your medical binder to appointments. You never know when you might need it! Imaging tests Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. A radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your health care provider (HCP). It is likely that the report will be sent directly to you through your patient portal or patient access system. You should discuss these results with your HCP. You will not have all of the following tests. Contrast material Contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. Contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. The contrast is not permanent and will leave your body in your urine immediately after the test. The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI. Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren’t working well. CT scan A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed picture. A CT scan of your head, neck, and chest, may be one of the tests to look for cancer. In most cases, contrast will be used. MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays. Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body. During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. Contrast is often used. A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots are cancer. It is normal for the brain, base of the tongue or tonsil lymphoid tissue, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. FDG-PET/CT An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear. It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites. If it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/ CT may not be needed. FDG-PET/CT can be done at the same time as a CT used for diagnosis. Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your neck using gel. Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used to guide a biopsy. Panoramic dental x-ray A panoramic dental -ray or panoramic x-ray (Panorex) uses a very small dose of radiation to capture the entire mouth in one image, including the teeth, upper and lower jaws, and surrounding structures and tissues. It is commonly performed by dentists and oral surgeons in everyday practice and may be used to plan treatment for dentures, braces, extractions, and implants. If you smoke or vape, seek help to quit A history of smoking or vaping nicotine increases your chances of developing head and neck, lung, and other cancers. Smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. They also greatly increase your chances of having side effects",

Smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. They also greatly increase your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. Cannabis use might also affect the amount of anesthesia used during surgery. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking and vaping. Nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most people who smoke or vape. The stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. If you smoke or vape, ask your care team about counseling and medicines to help you quit. In head and neck cancers, stopping smoking or vaping is essential to maximize the chance for cure and minimize side effects. For online support, try these websites: SmokeFree.gov BeTobaccoFree.gov CDC.gov/tobacco Biopsy A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid. Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in examining cells using a microscope (called cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer. The pathologist will determine the cancer subtype called tumor histology. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine needle biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB) use needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tumor or lymph node. An ultrasound or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph node biopsy. Biopsy of metastasis Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area of the body such as lymph nodes or lung. A biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to confirm the presence of cancer. If there is more than one metastasis, each site may be biopsied. The type of biopsy used depends on the location of the suspected metastases and other factors. Biomarker testing Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome. Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes. Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make. Most genes contain information about a specific protein. A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code. Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. This information may be helpful when choosing the best treatment for you. It is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. These tests are generally used in advanced or widely spread (metastatic) cancers. However, in comparison to other cancers, molecular testing has limited value in the treatment of mouth cancers since there are few drugs that specifically target the genetic mutations causing mouth cancers to grow and spread. MSI-H/dMMR mutation Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA. When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins. Some cancers have DNA mutations or changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high). This is often due to dMMR genes. PD-L1 testing Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune protein. If this protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response. This is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells. PDL1 expression is measured using a combined positive score (CPS), which measures the immune proteins in your tumor and your immune system. If your cancer expresses this protein and has a CPS of at least 1 percent or higher, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy by itself. Tumor mutational burden When there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H). Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers are often treated using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Tumor mutation testing Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor or blood to see if the cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations. This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your biological parents. In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. Some mutations can be targeted with specific therapies. If you feel something different around your neck, glands, tongue, or mouth area, please don’t wait! Go see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor.” Key points Results from imaging studies and biopsy may help determine your treatment plan. Often, information is collected over time, even as treatment begins. Online portals are a great way to access your test results. Please discuss your results with your health care provider A medical history and physical exam inform your care team about your overall health. Head and neck cancer and its treatment can affect the health of your jaw, teeth, and gums. Tell your dentist about your head and neck cancer and keep up with regular dental cleanings and checkups. Treatment can affect fertility. Talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy",

NCCN.org/patients/feedback 3 Mouth cancer staging How mouth cancer is staged TNM scores Mouth cancer stages Key points Cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. It describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. This chapter explains mouth cancer stages. How mouth cancer is staged A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have. This is called staging. Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. Staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. AJCC is just one type of staging system. Information gathered during staging: The extent (size) of the tumor (T): How large is the cancer? Has it grown into nearby areas? The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? If so, how many? Where? The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver? Biomarker testing: Does the cancer have any genes or mutations that might suggest treatment? Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. More information can be gathered as treatment begins. Doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next. Staging includes: Anatomic – based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node status (N), and distant metastasis (M). Prognostic – includes anatomic TNM. The prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches. Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic. Cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery. Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status. Clinical stage Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment. It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. An example might look like cN1 or cMIn mouth cancer, the clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy results. These tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis. Pathologic stage Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. An example might be pNIf you are given cancer drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might add a \"y\" and look like ypT Anyone can give up; It’s the easiest thing in the world to do, but to hold it together when everyone would expect for you to fall apart, now that is true strength.” Lymph nodes in the head and neck There are over 300 lymph nodes in the head and neck. Most tumors spread to nearby lymph nodes. TNM scores The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage mouth cancer. In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth. Based on imaging and pathology results, a score or number is assigned to each letter. The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. These scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. A TNM example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M T (tumor) – Depth and size of the main (primary) tumor and if the tumor has grown into nearby tissue (tumor extension). N (node) – If cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes M (metastasis) -– If cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized Locoregional or locally advanced – This refers to a tumor that has spread to tissue, organs, or lymph nodes near the mouth. Moderately or very advanced disease – This includes cancer that has spread to parts of the neck such as the bones and muscles of the jaw, sinuses, or skin. It might include cancer in the base of the skull or carotid artery. Metastatic – This is cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, including lung and distant lymph nodes. This might be referred to as very advanced disease. Not all stage 4 cancers are metastatic. Your preferences about treatment are always important. Talk to your care team and make your wishes known. Numbered stages Numbered stages are based on TNM scores. Stages range from stage 0 to stage",

Resectable – Tumor can be removed completely with surgery. Unresectable – Tumor cannot be removed completely with surgery. The tumor might involve major vessels or other normal critical structures making it unsafe to remove. Mouth cancer stages The following TNM staging information is used for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the mouth including mucosa of the lip. These are tumors that start in the surface (epithelium), which lines the inside of the mouth. The epithelial layer is made up of squamous cells. See Guide Tumor A tumor can grow into nearby structures. Tumor size is measured in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). A golf ball is 4 cm and a pea is 1 cm . Depth of invasion (DOI) is a measure of how deep the tumor has grown into the layers of tissue, not tumor thickness. Imaging scans such as an MRI can be used to calculate DOI. As depth of invasion increases, the risk of regional lymph node metastases also increases. Tis – This is carcinoma in situ, meaning that cancerous cells are found only in the squamous cell layer. T1 – Tumor is 2 cm or less with DOI of 5 mm or less. T2 – Tumor is 2 cm or less with DOI of more than 5 mm or tumor is between 2 cm and 4 cm with DOI of or less. T3 – Tumor is between 2 cm and 4 cm with DOI of more than or tumor is larger than 4 cm with DOI of or less. T4a – Moderately advanced local disease. Tumor is more than 4 cm with DOI of more than or tumor invades nearby structures only, such as through the cortical bone of the mandible or maxilla or involves the maxillary sinus or skin of the face. T4b – Very advanced local disease. Tumor has invaded the masticator space, pterygoid plates, or skull base and/or encases the internal carotid artery. Regional lymph node There are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body. They work as filters to help fight infection and remove harmful things from your body. The head and neck contain a network of more than 300 nodes. They are bound together with muscles, nerves, and blood and lymph vessels. Head and neck cancers sometimes spread to neck lymph nodes. Regional lymph nodes are found near the tumor. Cancer found in a regional lymph node is a lymph node metastasis. This is different than a distant metastasis, which is found outside the neck. When cancer has grown through and spreads outside of the lymph node, it is referred to as extranodal extension or extranodal extension-positive .\nAbout AML 5 What is AML? 5 What is blood? 7 What are blasts? 7 What's in this book? 7 What can you do to get the best care? Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer that starts in the stem cells of bone marrow. There are many subtypes of AML found in adults. This chapter will provide an overview of AML. What is AML? In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells. As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood. In turn, there are not enough healthy red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. This causes serious health issues. For this reason, AML is fatal if left untreated. Subtypes of AML There are many subtypes of AML. They are grouped and treated based on the presence or absence of certain gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes and other factors. In addition to AML, this book includes information about the following: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful. You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers. They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field. Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers. Cancer care is not the same for everyone. By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result. Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions. What is blood? AML is a type of blood cancer. Blood is a tissue. A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function. Blood’s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste. Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding. There are 4 main components of blood—plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma. Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water. There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen",

Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water. There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body. White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes) fight infections. WBCs include granulocytes (or neutrophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes. Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding. How are blood cells formed? Bone marrow is the organ that creates blood in our body. It is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones. Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells. Stem cells multiply to maintain a supply throughout our lifetime. Some of these stem cells gradually develop into blood cells through a process called differentiation. At any given time, the bone marrow contains cells at various stages of development, from very immature to nearly mature. Once a blood stem cell fully develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet, it is released into the bloodstream as needed. Blood cell formation All blood cells start as blood stem cells. A blood stem cell has to mature or go through many stages to become a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet. AML affects the myeloid progenitor cells, which develop into red blood cells, granulocytes (a type of white blood cell), and platelets. Copyright 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® . www.nccn.org AML starts in the blood stem cells and makes abnormal myeloblasts, also called blasts or leukemia cells. What are blasts? A blast is an immature white blood cell. Blasts are committed to becoming a type of blood cell. Myeloblasts mature into granulocytes also known as neutrophils. These are types of immune cells that help prevent and control infection. In AML, abnormal myeloblasts are found in the bone marrow or blood. These blasts crowd out other blood cells causing bone marrow or blood to not work as it should. What's in this book? This book is organized into the following chapters: Chapter 2: Testing for AML provides an overview of tests you might receive, and the role of genetic and biomarker mutation testing. Chapter 3: Types of treatment gives a general overview of AML treatment. Chapter 4: AML discusses treatment for AML. Chapter 5: APL discusses treatment of a rare subtype of AML. In APL, the abnormal fusion gene PML::RARA is found. Chapter 6: BPDCN discusses treatment of an aggressive subtype of AML. BPDCN can be found in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and/or skin. Chapter 7: Other resources provides information on patient advocacy groups and where to get help. What can you do to get the best care? Advocate for yourself. You have an important role to play in your care. In fact, you’re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team. Consider seeking the opinion of an AML specialist. The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care. With better understanding, you’ll be more prepared to discuss your care with your team and share your concerns. Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care. You may not know what to ask your care team. That’s common. Each chapter in this book ends with an important section called Questions to ask. These suggested questions will help you get more information on all aspects of your care. Take the next step and keep reading to learn what is the best care for you! 2 Testing for AML Overview General health tests Blood tests Fertility (all genders) Performance status Bone marrow tests Testing for AML biomarker and genetic changes Imaging tests Heart tests Lumbar puncture Key points Questions to ask Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat AML. This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect. Overview Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat AML. A diagnosis of AML is based on the presence of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or blood. The number of blasts required to be diagnosed with AML can vary. In general, the number of blasts must be 20 percent or more of all cells found in the bone marrow. This means that at least 1 out of every 5 bone marrow cells are blasts. However, a diagnosis of AML is possible with any number of blasts, particularly if certain gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes are also present. Unlike other cancers of organs, like lung cancer or breast cancer, AML does not have stages. Many cancers spread from the location where they originate, and the extent or severity of cancer is determined by how far it has spread. AML arises from the bone marrow, which is present in nearly all of our bones. Because AML cells arise from multiple bones and flow in the blood all over the body, traditional staging is not useful. Instead, AML testing looks for specific gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes, which can tell your care team how aggressive your leukemia might be. Possible tests and procedures can be found in Guide Information on possible tests and procedures can be found in this chapter. You do not need to know what all of these tests mean. It is ok to skip over information that doesn't interest you.

Medical history A medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. Be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. Bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. Some supplements interact with and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. Tell your care team about any symptoms you have. A medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. Physical exam During a physical exam, a health care provider may: Check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate. Check your height and weight. Listen to your lungs and heart. Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. h Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. Testing takes time. It might take weeks for all your test results to come in. Please wait to discuss the results with your doctor. Family history Your care team will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. This information is called a family history. Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. It’s important to know the specific type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing. Blood tests Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. They require a sample of blood, which is removed through a needle placed into a vein in your arm. Be prepared to have many blood tests during AML treatment and recovery to check treatment results, blood counts, and the health of organs like your liver and kidneys. Some possible tests are described next. The list starts with more common tests. Complete blood count and differential A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood. A CBC is a key test that gives a picture of your overall health. AML often causes low counts of healthy blood cells, but it can also present with a high number of abnormal, malignant (abnormal) white blood cells. There are several types of white blood cells. A differential counts the number of each type of white blood cell. It also checks if the counts are in balance with each other. This test may show a high number of blasts in the blood. Your care team will pay particular attention to the following CBC measurements: Hemoglobin (Hgb) is a measurement of how much oxygen can move through blood and if a red blood cell transfusion might be needed. Platelets (PLTs) are cells that make the clot, thus preventing or stopping the bleeding. h An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measures cells that fight bacteria and protect us from infections Blasts or leukemia cells can sometimes be detected in the blood and usually are reported as a percentage of cells. Comprehensive metabolic panel A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood. It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. Creatinine Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles. Every person generates a fixed amount of creatinine every day based on how much muscle they have. It is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. The level of creatinine in the blood tells how well the kidneys are working. Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys aren’t working as well as they were when someone had lower levels of creatinine. Blood urea nitrogen Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys. A high level of BUN can be a sign your kidneys aren’t working well. Electrolytes Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells and help move waste out of cells. Electrolytes are ions or particles with electrical charges that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and brain work as they should. Your body needs electrolytes to function properly. Lactate dehydrogenase Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most cells. Dying cells release LDH into blood. Fastgrowing cells, such as tumor cells, also release LDH. Liver function tests Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health of the liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. Levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or the bile ducts might be blocked. B12 and folic acid Vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate) help the body make new proteins. They are needed for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation. B12 and folic acid levels will be monitored. You may",

They are needed for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation. B12 and folic acid levels will be monitored. You may be given vitamin supplements, if needed. Iron Iron is important in maintaining body functions such as producing hemoglobin, the molecule in your blood that carries oxygen. You might be monitored for low levels of iron called iron deficiency. You may be given an intravenous (IV) iron supplement, if needed. It is possible to have too much iron in the body called overload. Therefore, only take what is prescribed by your doctor. Blood clotting tests Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into a gel-like form. The gel-like blood forms into a solid mass called a blood clot. Clotting is a process or series of events. Proteins, called coagulation factors, are needed for clotting. They are made by the liver. These tests are known together as a coagulation panel or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel. It is standard to screen for clotting problems. An impaired clotting process is common in leukemia. This is called coagulopathy. You may have bleeding and bruises or blood clots. HLA typing Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a protein found on the surface of most cells. It plays an important role in your body’s immune response. HLAs are unique to each person. They mark your body’s cells. Your body detects these markers to tell which cells are yours. In other words, all your cells have the same set of HLAs. Each person’s set of HLAs is called the HLA type or tissue type. HLA typing is a blood test that detects a person’s HLA type. This test is done before an allogeneic (donor) hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). To find a donor match, your proteins will be compared to the donor’s proteins to see how many proteins are the same. A very good match is needed for a transplant to be a treatment option. Otherwise, your body will reject the donor cells or the donor cells will react against your body. Blood or tissue samples from you and your blood relatives will be tested first. Fertility (all genders) Treatment with targeted therapy and other forms of systemic therapy can affect your fertility, or the ability to have children. If possible, ask your care team before starting therapy how cancer and cancer treatment might affect your fertility. Fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren’t sure at the moment. Fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. More information on fertility preservation can be found at NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Performance status Performance status (PS) is a person’s general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. Your state of general health will be rated using a PS scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score or the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). PS is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. Your preferences about treatment are always important. Bone marrow tests Leukemia starts in the bone marrow. To diagnose AML, samples of bone marrow are usually removed and tested before starting any treatment. The bone marrow sample should be reviewed by a pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis of AML. This review is often referred to as histology, histopathology, or hematopathology review. The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of cells. Tests will be done on the biopsied cells. There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: Bone marrow aspirate Bone marrow biopsy A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are bedside procedures. They are not surgeries and do not require an operating room. Your care team will try to make you as comfortable as possible during the procedures. In some places, sedation or anesthesia is provided during these procedures. The samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). You will likely lie on your belly or side. For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone. Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe. For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a small piece of bone. You may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days. Your skin may bruise. If the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) subtype of AML is suspected, you might also have a lymph node biopsy or a skin lesion biopsy. Flow cytometry Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to detect, identify, and count specific cells. Flow cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye to cells. The dyed cells are passed through a beam of light in a machine. The machine measures the number of cells, as well as things like the size and shape of the cells. Flow cytometry may be used on cells from circulating (peripheral) blood or from a bone marrow aspirate. A blood test can count the number of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the subtle differences between different types of blood cancers. Flow cytometry can detect these subtle differences. The most common use of flow cytometry is in the identification of markers on cells, particularly in the immune system (called immunophenotyping). Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping is a process",

The most common use of flow cytometry is in the identification of markers on cells, particularly in the immune system (called immunophenotyping). Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping is a process that uses antibodies to detect the presence or absence of white blood cell antigens called biomarkers. These antigens are proteins that can be found on the surface of or inside white blood cells. Certain biomarkers are targeted in AML treatment. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells. The cells are then studied using a microscope. IHC looks for the immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or tissue sample. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Samples of bone and liquid bone marrow are removed in a biopsy. Testing for AML biomarker and genetic changes Biomarker and genetic tests are used to learn more about your subtype of AML, to target treatment, and to determine the likely path the cancer will take called a prognosis. This genetic testing is different from family history genetic testing or genetic cancer risk testing. This testing looks for changes only in the leukemia cells that have developed over time, and not changes in the rest of the body’s cells. It is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. Inside our cells are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules. These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome. Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes. Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make. A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code. Proteins are given names such as FLTGenes are identified in italics like this: FLT AML cells sometimes have changes in genes and chromosomes that can be seen under a microscope or found with various other tests. Testing of your leukemia cells can gather specific information about your leukemia to help guide treatment. AML genetic changes AML cells can have changes in genes and chromosomes. Mutation testing looks for these changes or abnormalities that are unique to AML cells. Examples of such changes are called deletion, insertion, inversion, amplification, translocation (rearrangement), and point mutation. Amplification – When a part or whole chromosome or gene is increased (for example, duplicated) Deletion – When part of a chromosome or gene is missing such as del(5q) Insertion – When a new part of a chromosome or gene is included Inversion – Switching of parts within one chromosome such as inv(16) and inv(3) Point mutation – When part of a gene is changed Chromosome translocation and gene rearrangement – Switching of parts between 2 chromosomes. When described at the chromosome level, it is called a translocation. When described at the gene level, it is called rearrangement. For example, the chromosome translocation is written as t(8;21)(q22;q1) and its gene rearrangement is written as RUNX1::RUNX1T Leukemia predisposition syndromes Some hereditary cancer syndromes can be passed down from biological parent to child. A family history of leukemia can affect treatment. A skin punch biopsy might be done if a predisposition condition is suspected. If your blood was tested at diagnosis, you would see the genetic changes of the leukemia. However, these may not be the genetic changes you were born with. Therefore, a skin punch biopsy is used. In this procedure, a small piece of skin and connective tissue is removed to get DNA that hasn’t been altered by AML. This will be used to see if you inherited genes that increase your risk of leukemia. Leukemia predisposition syndrome can affect how your body responds to treatment. Blood and saliva can be used when AML cells disappear (in remission). Biological family members who are possible hematopoietic cell donors might be tested for leukemia predisposition syndrome. Testing of cells not affected by your leukemia (like skin) can help tell if you have a leukemia predisposition syndrome. AML mutation testing Mutation testing using methods such as karyotype (or cytogenetics), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) look for changes or abnormalities that are unique to AML cells (genes and chromosomes). A sample of your blood or bone marrow will be used to see if the AML cancer cells have any specific mutations. Some mutations may determine the type of treatment given. FISH Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA. FISH can look for changes (abnormalities) that are too small to be seen with other methods. It can only be used for known changes. Since this test doesn’t need growing cells, it can be performed on either a bone marrow or blood sample. Sometimes, a bone marrow sample is needed to get all the information the care team needs to help plan your treatment. Karyotype A karyotype is a picture of your chromosomes. Karyotype A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. A karyotype will show extra, missing, rearranged, or abnormal pieces of chromosomes. Since a karyotype requires growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or blood must be used. Next-generation sequencing Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a method used to determine a portion of a person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene has any mutations that might affect how",

Next-generation sequencing Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a method used to determine a portion of a person’s DNA sequence. It shows if a gene has any mutations that might affect how the gene works. NGS looks at the gene in a more detailed way than other methods and can find mutations that other methods might miss. PCR A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that can make millions or billions of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic information). PCR is very sensitive. It can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. These copies, called PCR products, might be used for NGS. This is important when testing for treatment response or remission. A real-time or reverse transcriptase (RT) is a type of PCR used to look for gene rearrangements such as PML::RARA. This aids in diagnosis and monitoring response to targeted therapies. Imaging tests In some cases, imaging tests may be performed. This is based on your individual situation. Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of the body to look for sites with leukemia outside the bone marrow. Leukemia can spread outside the bloodstream to lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. It rarely spreads to the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Imaging tests can also show areas of infection or bleeding that may impact your care. A radiologist, a medical expert in interpreting imaging tests, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor. While these reports might be available to you through your patient portal or patient access system, please wait to discuss these results with your care team. You will likely not have all of the following tests. Contrast material Contrast material is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body. It is used to make the pictures clearer. Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV). Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements. IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test. The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI. Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do. Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past. This is important. You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren’t working well. Brain CT scan A CT of the brain is used to look for bleeding. A CT or CAT (computed tomography) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. All the images are combined to make one detailed picture. Contrast may or may not be used. This is a very quick test. Brain MRI scan An MRI can show if the outer layer of the brain is swollen from leukemia (leukemic meningitis). An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. It does not use x-rays, which means there is no radiation delivered to your body during the test. Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist about any metal in your body. Contrast may or may not be used. A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. The space is small and enclosed. An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans. PET scan A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells. This gives an idea about how fast the cancer cells are growing. Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans. However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan. Also, not all bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer. It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET. Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan. An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Heart tests Heart or cardiac tests are used to see how well the heart works. These tests might be used to monitor treatment side effects or to measure your heart function before you start treatment. You might be referred to a heart specialist called a cardiologist. Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows electrical changes in your heart. It reveals information about your heart rate and rhythm. A prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc) occurs when your heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. Certain treatments can cause a prolonged QTc. If the QTc becomes too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart rhythms. Echocardiogram An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound waves to make pictures. It is a type of ultrasound. For this test, small patches will be placed on your chest to track your heartbeat. Next, a wand with gel on its tip will be slid across part of your bare chest. A picture of your beating heart",

Next, a wand with gel on its tip will be slid across part of your bare chest. A picture of your beating heart will be seen on a screen. The pictures will be recorded for future viewing. An echocardiogram shows the structure (valves and muscle thickness) and function of your heart (or ejection fraction). Ejection fraction is the amount of blood pumped out of the left side of your heart every time it beats. If the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart is lower than normal, this indicates decreased heart function. 66 It is important to understand what you are going through. If your doctor says something you do not understand, let them know 'I don’t fully understand what this means' or 'I don’t fully understand what you just said. Can you please explain it in simpler terms?' This is an important way of advocating for yourself.\" Lumbar puncture Leukemia can travel to the fluid that surrounds the spine or brain. This may cause symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and sensitivity to light. A test may be needed to know if leukemia cells are in your spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure that removes spinal fluid by inserting a needle into the middle of the lower back. It is also called a spinal tap. Key points In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells. As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood making it hard for blood to do its work. An aspirate or biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue or group of cells for testing. A diagnosis of AML is confirmed using a bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy. In general, to be diagnosed with AML, 20 percent or more myeloblasts must be present in the bone marrow or blood. This means that at least 1 out of every 5 cells are blasts. In certain cases, a diagnosis of AML is possible with any number of blasts, particularly if specific gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes are also present. Genetic and biomarker tests are used to learn more about your subtype of AML, to target treatment, and to determine the likely course the cancer will take called a prognosis. Questions to ask What subtype of AML do I have? What does this mean in terms of prognosis and treatment options? Is there a cancer center or hospital nearby that specializes in my subtype of AML? What tests will I have? How often will they be repeated? h Will my insurance pay for these tests? Who will talk with me about the next steps? When? 3 Types of treatment Care team Systemic therapy Chemotherapy Targeted therapy Clinical trials Hematopoietic cell transplant Supportive care Side effects Key points Questions to ask Treatment for all types of AML will be in phases. The goal of treatment is to put the cancer in remission. This chapter provides an overview of possible treatments and what to expect. Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for your subtype of AML. Results from blood tests, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies will be used to guide your treatment plan. It is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan. Care team Treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) takes a team approach. Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT). An MDT is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. This team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. Ask who will coordinate your care. Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. Get to know your care team and help them get to know you. Your team might include the following doctors: A hematologist or hematologic oncologist is a medical expert in blood diseases and blood cancers and treats these conditions. A medical oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy. A pathologist or hematopathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing. Systemic therapy Systemic therapy works throughout the body. Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Systemic therapy might be used alone or with other therapies. Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment. Your preferences about treatment are important. If you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team. You will likely get either a catheter or a port to deliver systemic therapy, fluids, and blood products into your body. A catheter is a thin, long tube that is often placed in the upper arm. This goes into a large vein and stays there until treatment is complete. A port is a small, round disc that is usually placed in the chest. The type and location of catheter or port will be tailored to your needs and treatment plans. Treatment options Treatment options are often described in the following ways: Preferred therapies have the most evidence they work better and may be safer than other therapies. Other recommended therapies may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer. Therapies used in certain cases work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the standard of care for treating AML.

Other recommended therapies may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer. Therapies used in certain cases work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the standard of care for treating AML. Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and normal cells. Standard of care is the best-known way to treat a particular disease based on past clinical trials. There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you. Chemotherapy is most often a liquid that is slowly injected into a vein with a needle. The final dose differs between people because it is based on body weight. In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. This allows the body to recover before the next cycle. Cycles vary in length depending on which chemotherapy is used. You might spend time in the hospital during treatment. Types of chemotherapy There are many types of chemotherapy used to treat AML. Often chemotherapies are combined. This is called multi-agent chemotherapy or a multi-agent regimen. Each chemotherapy works in a different way and causes different side effects. Talk to your care team about the types of chemotherapy you will be given, when you will get them, and what side effects to expect. Antimetabolites Antimetabolites prevent the building blocks of DNA from being used. Examples include: Cladribine (Mavenclad) Clofarabine (Clolar) Cytarabine (Ara-C) Fludarabine Methotrexate Anthracyclines Anthracyclines damage and disrupt the making of DNA causing cell death of both cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Some anthracyclines can cause heart issues. They may not be an option for you. There is a limit to how much you can receive in your lifetime. Anthracycline examples include daunorubicin, idarubicin (Idamycin PFS), and mitoxantrone (Novantrone). Dual-drug liposome of cytarabine and daunorubicin (CPX-351 or Vyxeos) includes an antimetabolite and an anthracycline. Cytarabine Cytarabine is an anthracycline. Cytarabine (also called Ara-C) is used in many treatment regimens. It might be used alone or in combination with other drugs. It might be given as a single dose to reduce a very high white blood cell count. There are different doses for cytarabine (Ara-C): Standard High (HiDAC) Intermediate Low (LDAC) The dose you will receive is based on many factors. Ask your care team for the details of your treatment. What is the dose? How often is treatment received? How many treatment cycles are needed? Will I need to spend time in the hospital? If so, for how long? Cytarabine or methotrexate may be used to treat AML in the fluid that surrounds the spine or brain. In this case, it is injected into the spinal fluid. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy. Hypomethylating agents Methyl groups are molecules found in DNA. Leukemia cells often have too many methyl groups. These extra groups can block genes from being turned on and off. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) block methyl groups from binding to DNA. They turn silenced genes back on, which allows leukemic blasts to mature into normal cells. Azacitidine (Vidaza) and decitabine (Dacogen) are HMAs. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a form of systemic therapy that focuses on specific or unique features of cancer cells. Targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the body. These drugs stop the action of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/or survive. Some examples of targeted therapies can be found in Guide CD33 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a type of targeted therapy that is linked to a chemotherapy drug. It attaches to a cell surface protein called CD33, then enters the cell. Once inside, chemotherapy is released. Many leukemic blasts have CD33 proteins. Mature blood cells do not have CD33 and are not affected. GO may delay blood count recovery and cause liver issues. Core binding factor Core binding factor (CBF) creates a shortage of all types of mature blood cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) might be used in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine to treat AML with CBF or other genetic abnormalities. FLT3 Gilteritinib, quizartinib, midostaurin, or sorafenib is used to treat AML with certain FLT3 mutations such as FLT3-ITD and FLT3- TKD. Sorafenib or quizartinib is used to treat AML with an FLT3-ITD mutation.

    "content": "the surface layer of tissue surrounding the ovaries, called the epithelium. These cancers can also start in the fallopian tube, close to where the tube meets the ovary. This guide provides treatment recommendations for common and rare ovarian cancers. The ovaries The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. In addition to the 2 ovaries, this system includes the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. The ovaries make eggs needed for sexual reproduction. They also release hormones that affect breast growth, body shape, and the menstrual cycle (periods). Each ovary is about the size and shape of a grape. One is on the left side of the uterus and the other is on the right. Each is surrounded by a long, thin tube called a fallopian tube. After an egg is pushed out by the ovary, it is caught by the fallopian tube and travels into the uterus. Here the fetus grows and develops during pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, this leads to a period. The uterus and at least 1 ovary and fallopian tube are needed for menstruation and pregnancy. The female reproductive system The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. Types of ovarian cancer Most ovarian cancers are found in the outer surface of the ovaries, called the epithelium. There are more than 5 types of epithelial ovarian cancer. The most common forms are: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) High-grade endometrioid carcinoma Less common ovarian cancers Rare types of ovarian cancer are called less common ovarian cancers (LCOCs) or less common ovarian histologies (LCOHs). They can start in the epithelium, in tissues that support the ovaries, or in the reproductive (egg) cells of the ovary. Less common epithelial ovarian cancers include: Low-grade serous carcinoma Low-grade endometrioid carcinoma Carcinosarcoma (also called malignant mixed Mullerian tumors) Clear cell carcinoma Mucinous carcinoma Borderline epithelial tumor (also called low malignant potential tumors) Less common non-epithelial ovarian cancers include: Malignant sex-cord stromal tumors Malignant germ cell tumors Primary peritoneal cancer Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers the abdominal organs. The treatment information in this guide also applies to primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer. How is the type determined? To diagnose ovarian cancer and determine the cancer type, tumor tissue needs to be removed from your body and tested. If surgery is planned first, the tumor and other tissues removed during surgery will be tested. If chemotherapy is planned first, a biopsy will be performed to remove a sample of the tumor. A physician expert called a pathologist determines the type of ovarian cancer by examining the cancerous tissue. The pathologist also determines the cancer grade. The grade is a rating of how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope. High-grade cancers grow and spread more quickly than low-grade cancers. The cancer grade is different than the stage. Stages are categories that describe where the cancer has or hasn't spread from the ovary. Surgery is needed in order to know exactly how much cancer is in the body. Testing can provide a best guess of how far the cancer has spread before surgery. Cancer care plan Your treatment team Treatment for ovarian cancer takes a team of experts. When possible, a gynecologic oncologist should perform the initial surgery. This type of doctor is an expert in surgery and chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers. Your care team may also include a medical oncologist. This doctor is an expert in treating cancer with chemotherapy and other medicines. You may also receive care from registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, genetic counselors, sexual health experts, and others. Ask for the names and contact information of your care providers to be included in the treatment plan. Cancer treatment may be improved if your primary care provider is involved. They can help manage other health conditions that may be affected by your cancer treatment. Your treatment plan There isn't one treatment plan that is best for everyone. There is often more than one option, including clinical trials. Clinical trials study the safety and effectiveness of investigational treatments. The treatment that you and your care team agree on should be noted in the treatment plan, along with possible side effects. Keep in mind that your plan may change. Testing may provide new information. Your feelings about treatment may change. Side effects or other health conditions may prompt a change of plan. Key points The ovaries are a pair of grapesized organs in the pelvis. They make hormones and eggs for sexual reproduction. Most ovarian cancers affect the layer of tissue surrounding the ovaries, called the epithelium. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and high-grade endometrioid carcinoma are the most common types of ovarian tumors. Less common ovarian cancers can start in the epithelium, in tissues that support the ovaries, or in the reproductive (egg) cells of the ovary. Treating ovarian cancer takes a team of experts. Gynecologic oncologists and medical oncologists often work together to plan your treatment. 2 Testing for ovarian cancer Abdominal and pelvic exam Imaging tests Biopsy Family history and genetic testing Nutritional and digestive tract health Blood tests Biomarker testing Key points This chapter describes the testing used to learn more about suspected ovarian cancer, including whether surgery is possible. Ovarian cancer can cause changes in the body that you can feel or notice. But you might not have symptoms until the tumor has grown large or the cancer has spread. Common symptoms include: Feeling bloated Heartburn and indigestion Pain or pressure in the pelvis or belly Trouble eating or feeling full fast Having to urinate often or urgently Pain during sex These symptoms can also be caused by hormonal changes or other common health problems.",

Ovarian cancer is more likely to be the cause if the symptoms: h Began less than 1 year ago, h Occur more than 12 days per month, and Are becoming more severe over time. If your provider suspects ovarian cancer based on your symptoms, you will have testing as described in this chapter. Testing helps determine the clinical (pre-treatment) stage. The clinical stage provides a best guess of how far the cancer has spread. It is a best guess because surgery is needed in order to know exactly how much cancer is in the body. Testing also helps determine whether surgery first is the best treatment. Having surgery first may not be possible based on the size and location of the tumor, or because of other health factors. Abdominal and pelvic exam Your provider will feel different areas of your belly. This is called an abdominal exam. They are checking to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. Your doctor will also feel for signs of fluid buildup (ascites) in the belly area or around the ovaries. Your provider will also feel for abnormal changes in the size, shape, or position of your ovaries, cervix, and uterus. This is called a pelvic exam. A widening instrument, called a speculum, is used to view your vagina and cervix. A sample of cells may be removed for testing. This is known as a Pap test. It is used to detect cervical cancer or pre-cancer, not ovarian cancer. Sometimes, a biopsy of the uterine lining (an endometrial biopsy) may be part of the initial evaluation during the pelvic exam. This test can rule out a uterine cancer. An exam of the rectum and vagina together may also be done to check for cancer in the space between the rectum and vagina. This is called a rectovaginal exam. Imaging tests Imaging tests can show the location, size, and shape of an ovarian tumor. They can also show if the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries. Your care team will tell you how to prepare for your imaging tests. Ultrasound Ultrasound is often the first imaging test used to look for ovarian cancer. It uses sound waves to make pictures of areas inside of the body. Ultrasound is good at showing the size, shape, and location of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and nearby tissues. It can also show if there is a mass in the ovary and whether the mass is solid or filled with fluid. The 2 types of ultrasounds that may be used to look for ovarian cancer are described next. Both are done using a hand-held device called an ultrasound probe. Ultrasounds are generally painless, but you may feel some discomfort when the probe is inserted. For a transabdominal ultrasound, a gel will be spread on your abdomen and pelvis. The gel helps to make the pictures clearer. Your doctor will place the probe on your skin and guide it back and forth in the gel. For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor will insert the probe into your vagina. This may help the doctor see your ovaries more clearly. Transvaginal ultrasound Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. For a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe is inserted into the vagina. Ultrasounds are generally painless, but you may feel some discomfort when the probe is inserted. CT Imaging to look for ovarian cancer may include computed tomography (CT) scans of your abdomen, pelvis, and chest. CT scans are good at showing if the cancer has spread outside of the ovaries. They may also show if nearby lymph nodes are bigger than normal. This can be a sign that the cancer has spread. If you can have it, a substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. Before the scan you will be asked to drink a large glass of oral contrast. A contrast agent will also be injected into your vein. It may cause you to feel flushed or get hives. Rarely, allergic reactions can occur. Tell your team if you've had an allergic reaction to contrast in the past. A CT scanner is a large machine with a tunnel in the middle. While you lie on a table that moves through the tunnel, the scanner will rotate an x-ray beam around you to take pictures from many angles. MRI If the ultrasound images are unclear, you may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your abdomen and pelvis. An MRI of your chest or liver may be used to look for signs of cancer spread. MRI doesn’t use radiation. It uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of areas inside the body. Getting an MRI scan is similar to getting a CT scan but takes longer. Like a CT scan, a contrast agent may be used to make the pictures clearer. You will lie on a table that moves through a large tunnel in the scanning machine. The machine is more enclosed than a CT scan. Tell your care team if you get nervous in enclosed spaces. You may be given a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax. CT scan A CT scan is a more detailed kind of -ray. It takes a lot of pictures, or images, from different angles. A computer then combines the images to make 3-D pictures. PET CT or MRI are sometimes combined with positron emission tomography (PET). A PET scan shows how your cells are using a simple form of sugar,",

A PET scan shows how your cells are using a simple form of sugar, which can be helpful for identifying cancer. A sugar radiotracer is put into your body through a vein. The radiotracer puts out a small amount of energy that is detected by the machine that takes pictures. Cancer cells appear brighter because they use sugar faster than normal cells. PET is very good at showing small groups of cancer cells. This test may also be useful for showing if ovarian cancer has spread. Chest x-ray A chest -ray can show if cancer has spread to your lungs. It may be ordered with other tests when ovarian cancer is first suspected or found. It may also be used to check treatment results. A chest x-ray is fast and painless and uses small amounts of radiation. Diagnostic laparoscopy If the cancer is advanced, you may have a diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment. The goal is to learn how much cancer is in the abdomen. It helps your doctors to decide whether surgery can be the first treatment, or if chemotherapy is needed first. This minimally invasive procedure involves making a tiny cut in the abdomen. A thin tube with a light and a camera (laparoscope) is used to view the lining of the abdomen and the surface of organs in the abdomen. Tissue samples are taken and tested for cancer cells in a lab. Biopsy To diagnose ovarian cancer, a sample of tissue must be removed from your body for testing. This is called a biopsy. The biopsy is usually done during initial surgery to remove the cancer. But sometimes a biopsy is done to diagnose ovarian cancer before surgery or other planned treatment. This may be the case if the cancer has spread too much to be removed by surgery initially and chemotherapy is needed first. In such cases, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, core biopsy, or paracentesis may be used. FNA uses a very thin needle to remove a small sample of tissue from the tumor. A core biopsy removes tissue samples with a hollow needle. For paracentesis, a long, thin needle is inserted through the skin of the belly to remove a sample of fluid. The biopsy samples are sent to a pathologist for testing. A pathologist is a doctor who is an expert in testing cells to find disease. The pathologist views the samples with a microscope to look for cancer cells. If the cells are cancerous, the pathologist notes their appearance and other features. Prior surgery or biopsy The cancer may have been found during a surgery or biopsy performed by another doctor. In this case, your treatment team will need to review the prior surgery and testing results. A pathologist will examine the tumor tissue with a microscope to make sure it is ovarian cancer. Your doctors will also want to know if any cancer was left in your body after surgery. Family history and genetic testing Ovarian cancer usually occurs for unknown reasons. However, about 1 in 6 ovarian cancers is caused by mutations (changes) in genes that are passed down from parent to child. This is called hereditary ovarian cancer. It is most often caused by mutations in either breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2). Everyone has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. When working properly, they are helpful and repair damaged cells. But mutations in these genes increase the risk of developing ovarian, breast, and some other cancers. Another cause of hereditary ovarian cancer is Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colon and uterine cancers but can also cause ovarian and other cancers. Ovarian cancer associated with a BRCA mutation or Lynch syndrome usually starts at a younger age than non-hereditary ovarian cancer. Using your age, health history, and family history, your doctor will assess how likely you are to have hereditary ovarian cancer. Genetic testing can tell if you have a mutation in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play a role in hereditary cancer. It is recommended for everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer. If initial treatment works well, BRCA status (whether you have a BRCA mutation) plays an important role in guiding decisions about maintenance therapy. Genetic testing may be done through your gynecology or oncology care team, or by a genetic counselor. The testing is done on normal tissue–either blood, saliva, or a cheek swab. Those with a positive genetic test or who have a strong cancer family history should see a health expert. This is typically a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor has special training to help patients understand changes in genes that are related to disease. There are many other hereditary syndromes besides BRCA and Lynch. Genetic testing typically tests for all of them. Commercial genetic tests currently available over the counter look for the most common gene mutations, but aren't comprehensive. In addition to testing for germline (inherited) BRCA mutations, the tumor itself should be tested for mutations in the BRCA and related genes. These are known as somatic or tumor mutations. Genetic testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It can determine if you have a mutation in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play a role in hereditary cancer. Nutritional and digestive tract health Your provider may ask about your diet and eating habits. Symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pain in the pelvis or abdomen, difficulty eating, and feeling full quickly. These symptoms may cause you to eat less in general, or to eat foods lacking in nutrients. Your overall health and nutrition level can have an impact on",

Nutritional and digestive tract health Your provider may ask about your diet and eating habits. Symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pain in the pelvis or abdomen, difficulty eating, and feeling full quickly. These symptoms may cause you to eat less in general, or to eat foods lacking in nutrients. Your overall health and nutrition level can have an impact on the success of surgery and other treatment outcomes. If you need help planning healthy meals or have questions about your diet, ask your provider for a referral to a registered dietitian or nutritionist. Your doctor may want to check your gastrointestinal (GI) tract using an imaging test. The GI tract is made of the organs that food passes through when you eat. This includes your stomach, small bowel, and large bowel (rectum and colon). An imaging tool called a scope is used to examine these organs. A scope is a long, thin tube with a light and a camera that can be guided into your body. A colonoscopy is used to examine the large bowel. This involves inserting a scope into your anus and guiding it through the rectum and colon. To examine the upper GI tract, a scope is guided down the throat into the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. This is called an upper endoscopy. Blood tests The following tests are not used alone to diagnose ovarian cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems. General health A complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a sample of blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. White blood cells fight infection. Platelets help to control bleeding. Your blood counts may be too low or too high because of cancer or other health problems. A blood chemistry profile measures the levels of different chemicals that are affected by your kidneys, bones, and other organs and tissues. Levels that are too high or too low may be a sign that an organ isn’t working well. Abnormal levels may also be caused by the spread of cancer or by other diseases. This test can also provide information about nutrient intake, such as protein levels. This can help guide treatment decisions. The liver is an organ that does many important jobs, such as removing toxins from your blood. Liver function tests measure chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. Levels that are too high or low may be a sign of liver damage or cancer spread. Tumor markers A tumor marker is a substance found in body tissue or fluid that may be a sign of cancer. Along with other information, tumor markers can help diagnose ovarian cancer and monitor response to treatment. A cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) test is the most common tumor marker test for ovarian cancer. High levels of this protein in the blood may be a sign of ovarian or other cancers. A CA-125 test alone cannot diagnose ovarian cancer. Health problems that are not cancer, such as endometriosis and diverticulitis, can raise your CA-125 level. Some ovarian cancers don’t cause CA-125 to rise. Your blood may also be tested for the following tumor markers. These may be found in higherthan-normal amounts in people with less common ovarian cancers (LCOCs). Inhibin (typically inhibin A and inhibin B) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CA 19-9 HE4 Biomarker testing Biomarkers are features of the tumor that can help guide your treatment. They are often mutations (changes) in the DNA of the cancer cells. Testing for biomarkers involves analyzing a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a sample of blood. The results can be used to determine whether you can join certain clinical trials, and whether you may benefit from specific maintenance therapies. Other names for biomarker testing include molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic testing, tumor gene testing, next-generation sequencing (NGS), mutation testing, liquid biopsy, and precision oncology. BRCA and HRD A BRCA mutation is the most important biomarker used to plan ovarian cancer treatment. Everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer should have the tumor tested for mutations in the BRCA genes, and in other similar genes important in DNA repair. This is different than genetic testing of the blood for inherited (germline) BRCA mutations. Mutations in the tumor itself are known as somatic or simply “tumor” mutations. BRCA mutations are a form of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). This means that if you have a BRCA mutation, the cancer is also homologous recombination deficient or HRD positive. However, you can also have an HRD-positive tumor without a BRCA mutation. Other changes in the tumor’s DNA can make it homologous recombination deficient. The tumor's BRCA and HRD status are used to guide decisions about maintenance therapy after initial treatment. Other biomarkers The timing of testing for the biomarkers described next can vary. Some providers test for these (in addition to BRCA) early in the treatment process. Others may only test for BRCA and wait to see if therapies that require other biomarkers are needed. However, testing for these biomarkers is generally recommended for ovarian cancer that returns after treatment (recurrent). Testing is performed on removed tumor tissue. Microsatellite instability (MSI) Mismatch repair (MMR) HER2 expression Tumor mutational burden (TMB) BRAF V600E mutation Folate receptor alpha (FRα) expression RET mutations NTRK gene fusion Key points The biopsy to diagnose ovarian cancer is usually done during initial surgery.

These cancers are treated with surgery and chemotherapy. If treatment works well, maintenance therapy may be an option for more advanced cancers. Surgery Surgery is often the first treatment if you are willing and able to have it. Sometimes chemotherapy is given first. Surgery should be performed by a gynecologic oncologist. This is a surgeon who is an expert in cancers that start in the female reproductive organs. If your team recommends chemotherapy before surgery, see page The main goals of surgery are to: Remove all or as much of the cancer as possible, and Learn how far the cancer has spread. Hysterectomy with BSO The most common surgery for ovarian cancer is hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy (BSO). A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the uterus. When the cervix is removed in addition to the uterus, it is called a total or complete hysterectomy. A BSO removes both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. Pregnancy isn’t possible after a hysterectomy. Fertility-sparing surgery (described below) may be an option for some very early ovarian cancers that haven't spread beyond the ovaries. If cancer has spread outside the ovaries, your surgeon will attempt to remove as much of it as possible. This is called debulking or cytoreductive surgery. The extent of the surgery depends on how far the cancer has spread. It may involve removing all or part of nearby organs. Lymph nodes that look abnormal or that are larger than normal will also be removed when possible. Fertility-sparing surgery Pregnancy isn’t possible after the uterus is removed. This is difficult for those wishing to get pregnant in the future. Fertility-sparing surgery may be an option. This involves removing one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes but leaving the uterus in place. Surgery to remove one ovary and its fallopian tube is called a unilateral salpingooophorectomy (USO). USO is only an option if the cancer is in 1 ovary and the cancer is appropriate for this procedure. After a USO, you may still be able to become pregnant naturally if you haven’t entered menopause. If the cancer is in both ovaries, a BSO (without hysterectomy) may be an option. While you can't become pregnant naturally after a BSO, pregnancy may be possible using assisted reproductive approaches. One such approach is in vitro fertilization (IVF). In IVF, eggs are fertilized with sperm in a lab to create embryos. The embryos are implanted into the uterus or frozen for future use. The eggs used for IVF may be yours (removed from your ovary before surgery) or donor eggs. Donor eggs are removed from women who have volunteered to go through hormone treatment to stimulate egg production in the ovaries. Surgical methods A laparotomy is the most common method for ovarian cancer surgery. A laparotomy is a long surgical cut in the abdomen. It is often an upand-down (vertical) cut from the top of the belly button down to the pelvic bone. This lets your doctor see the tumor and other organs and tissues in your abdomen and pelvis. This method is recommended most often when surgical staging (described next) or cytoreductive surgery is planned. Less often, a minimally invasive type of surgery called laparoscopy may be used. The surgery is performed through a few small cuts in the abdomen. Laparoscopy may be used in select cases, such as when cancer is only in the ovaries. This surgery should only be done by a gynecologic oncologist experienced in this method. Hysterectomy and BSO The most commonly used surgery for ovarian cancer removes the uterus, both ovaries, and both fallopian tubes. Surgical staging If it does not look like the cancer has spread, surgical staging should be performed. Surgical staging is the most accurate way to stage ovarian cancer. This involves taking samples during surgery from organs and tissues where ovarian cancer often spreads. The samples are tested for cancer cells. Your surgeon will also take samples from nearby tissues where it looks like cancer hasn’t spread. This is done to check for cancer cells that have spread outside the ovaries or pelvis and can only be seen with a microscope. These are called microscopic metastases. The omentum and sometimes nearby lymph nodes will be removed. The omentum is the fatty layer of tissue that covers organs in the belly (abdomen). Lymph nodes are groups of disease-fighting cells where cancer can also spread. If there is fluid buildup in the",

Lymph nodes are groups of disease-fighting cells where cancer can also spread. If there is fluid buildup in the abdomen, the fluid will also be sampled. If there isn’t fluid buildup, your doctor may “rinse” the space inside your belly with a special liquid. This is called a peritoneal washing. Samples of the liquid will then be tested for cancer cells. Preparing for surgery Your treatment team will give you instructions on how to prepare for surgery. You may be asked to stop taking some medicines for a short time. You also should not eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery. On the day of your surgery, you will be given medicine to put you into a deep sleep so you won’t feel pain. This is called general anesthesia. Surgery may take 3 or more hours to complete. More or less time may be needed depending on how much tissue is removed. After the surgery, expect to stay in the hospital for a few days or weeks to recover. You may feel some pain and tenderness in your belly and pelvis. It may last for a few days or weeks. You may be able to return to normal activities in a few weeks. The time it takes to fully recover varies from person to person. It also varies depending on the extent of the surgery. Premature menopause If you have not entered menopause, surgery that removes both ovaries will cause it. This is known as surgical menopause. It is caused by the sudden drop in estrogen in the body. This drop can cause symptoms of menopause, including: Hot flashes Sleeping problems Night sweats Weight gain Changes in mood Thinning, drying, and irritation of the vaginal lining (vaginal atrophy) When caused by surgery, the symptoms of menopause may be sudden and more severe. There are also long-term risks of not having enough estrogen. They include heart or blood vessel problems (cardiovascular disease) and bone loss (osteoporosis). If you have symptoms of surgical menopause, your doctor may suggest non-hormonal medicine or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Discussion with a menopausal symptom team is recommended to determine whether HRT is right for you. Other risks and side effects With any type of surgery, there are health risks and side effects. Common side effects include pain, swelling, and scars. Common side effects of ovarian cancer surgery include leg swelling, trouble urinating, and constipation. Cancer and recent abdominal surgery are risk factors for developing blood clots, also known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Many patients are placed on blood thinners (either oral medications or injections) for up to 4 weeks after surgery to help prevent blood clots. If surgery first isn’t an option Having surgery first may not be an option. This could be due to the size or location of the tumor, other health conditions, or your overall health. In this case, chemotherapy is given first to shrink the cancer. You will need a biopsy to confirm that the tumor is ovarian cancer before starting chemotherapy. At this time, preferred regimens include: h Paclitaxel and carboplatin Paclitaxel, carboplatin, bevacizumab, and maintenance bevacizumab While the above regimens are preferred, there are other recommended options for chemotherapy. Your team will take into account any medical conditions and your overall health. These regimens may change as new information becomes available. After a few cycles of chemotherapy (2 to 3 months), your doctor will check to see how well chemotherapy worked and if surgery is an option. The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, as well as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus. Surgery performed after chemotherapy is called interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS). For stage 3 disease, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may be used during ICS. HIPEC is a technique in which chemotherapy is warmed and then circulated in the spaces between the organs of the abdomen during surgery. If cancer improves after several cycles of chemotherapy, surgery is usually recommended. If cancer stays the same, your doctor may recommend proceeding with surgery or continuing chemotherapy to see if there is improvement. After surgery, more chemotherapy is usually given. Maintenance therapy may follow once your cancer is in remission. Staging The information gained during surgery and surgical staging is used to determine the pathologic (post-surgery) stage. The pathologic stage provides the most accurate picture of how far the cancer has spread. It is used to guide treatment after surgery. A staging system is a standard way of describing the extent of cancer in the body. There are 2 staging systems for ovarian cancer. One was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the other by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). They are similar but the FIGO system is used most often. In the FIGO system, the cancer stage is defined by 3 main areas of cancer growth: The extent of the first (primary) tumor The spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes The spread of cancer to distant sites Ovarian cancer stages are numbered from 1 to Doctors write cancer stages as I, II, III, and IV. The stages are also divided into smaller groups, called substages. This helps to describe the extent of cancer in more detail. The FIGO stages of ovarian cancer are described on the following pages. Cancers of the same stage tend to have similar outcomes. Early-stage cancers tend to have better outcomes than more advanced cancers. Other factors not used for staging",

Cancers of the same stage tend to have similar outcomes. Early-stage cancers tend to have better outcomes than more advanced cancers. Other factors not used for staging, such as your general health, are also important. Stage 1A Cancer is in one ovary. The outer sac (capsule) of the ovary is intact. There is no cancer on the outside surface of the ovary. No cancer cells are found in ascites or washings. Stage 1B Cancer is in both ovaries. The capsules are intact and there is no cancer on the outside surface of the ovaries. No cancer cells are found in ascites or washings. Stage 1C Cancer is in one or both ovaries and one or more of the following has also happened: • Stage 1C1 – The capsule of the ovary broke open during surgery. This is called surgical spill. • Stage 1C2 – The capsule of the ovary broke open before surgery, or there is cancer on the outer surface of the ovary or fallopian tube. • Stage 1C3 – Cancer cells are found in ascites or washings Stage 2A There is cancer in one or both ovaries. Cancer has grown into and/or spread implants on the uterus and/or fallopian tubes. Stage 2B Cancer is in one or both ovaries. Cancer has grown into and/or spread implants on other organs or tissues in the pelvis, such as the bladder, colon, or rectum. Stage 3A1 There is cancer in one or both ovaries. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen (retroperitoneal lymph nodes). • Stage 3A1 (i) – Cancer in the lymph nodes is (millimeters) or smaller. • Stage 3A1 (ii) – Cancer in the lymph nodes is larger than . Stage 3A2 Cancer has spread to the tissue lining the abdomen. The cancer is so small it can only be seen with a microscope. There may also be cancer in lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen. Stage 3B There is visible cancer on the tissue lining the abdomen. The area of cancer is smaller than a peanut (about 2 centimeters or smaller). There may also be cancer in lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen. Stage 3C There is visible cancer on the tissue lining the abdomen. The area of cancer is larger than 2 cm. There might be cancer in lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen. The cancer may have also spread to the outer surface of the liver or spleen. Stage 4 Cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Stage 4A – There are cancer cells in the fluid around the lungs. This is called a malignant pleural effusion. • Stage 4B – Cancer has spread to the inside of the liver or spleen, to distant lymph nodes, or to other organs outside the abdomen. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of medicine(s) to kill cancer cells. It is a type of systemic therapy. When given before surgery, chemotherapy is called neoadjuvant therapy. When given after surgery, it is called primary or adjuvant chemotherapy. Platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended for ovarian cancer. These medicines contain the metal platinum. Carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin are examples. One of these is often given with a different type of chemotherapy called a taxane. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are taxanes. Your options for chemotherapy will depend on your age and overall health. Your provider will also consider your risk for nerve damage, called peripheral neuropathy. This common side effect of paclitaxel causes pain, tingling, and numbness, often in the hands and feet. Chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment followed by days of rest. This allows the body to recover before the next treatment. The cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. Stage 1 Chemotherapy is recommended after surgery for most newly diagnosed stage 1 cancers. Observation may be an option for a stage 1A or 1B, low-grade tumor. Ask your doctor if this applies to your cancer. At this time, the preferred chemotherapy regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given every 3 weeks. If you can't have this regimen, there are other recommended options. Six cycles of chemotherapy are recommended for high-grade serous tumors. Between 3 and 6 cycles are recommended for all other stage 1 tumors. The specific number of cycles needed depends on the tumor type and other factors. Stages 2, 3, and 4 For common tumor types, chemotherapy is recommended after surgery for all newly diagnosed stage 2, 3, and 4 ovarian cancers. At this time, the preferred chemotherapy regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given every 3 weeks. Six cycles are given for stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers. If you can't have this regimen, there are other recommended options. A drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) may be added to your chemotherapy. It stops the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumor. If chemotherapy works well, the next step may include maintenance therapy. See page 31 for more information. How chemotherapy is given Most chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is given intravenously. This means the medicine is put directly into your bloodstream through a vein. You may get a port to receive chemotherapy. This is a small, round disc that is usually placed under",

If chemotherapy works well, the next step may include maintenance therapy. See page 31 for more information. How chemotherapy is given Most chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is given intravenously. This means the medicine is put directly into your bloodstream through a vein. You may get a port to receive chemotherapy. This is a small, round disc that is usually placed under your skin in the upper chest. It is inserted during a minor surgery and stays in the body until treatment is complete. After treatment the port can be easily removed. Once the port is removed, the skin will heal. Chemotherapy medicine can also be slowly injected into the abdomen. This is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. When given this way, higher doses of the drugs are delivered directly to the cancer cells in the belly area. IP chemotherapy is given through a thin tube called a catheter. The catheter is usually connected to a port placed inside the abdomen during surgery. Monitoring during chemotherapy Your doctor will monitor how well the chemotherapy is working and assess for side effects. Expect to have a physical exam every 1 to 3 cycles. A pelvic and rectovaginal exam may be done at the same time. Imaging and blood tests are ordered as needed. Testing for CA-125 or other tumor markers may be performed before each cycle of chemotherapy. Side effects of chemotherapy Common side effects of chemotherapy include: Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Mouth sores Hair loss Fatigue Increased risk of infection Bleeding or bruising easily Nerve damage (neuropathy) The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the specific medicines being used, the dose, and other factors. In general, side effects are caused by the death of fast-growing cells, Side effects Managing side effects is a shared effort between you and your care team. It is important to speak up about bothersome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. Ask about your options for managing or relieving the effects of treatment. More information on nausea and vomiting is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. which are found in the bowel, mouth, and blood. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy tends to cause more severe side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. This includes infections, kidney damage, pain in the belly, and nerve damage. Rare but serious side effects include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ask your care team for a full list of common and rare side effects of the drugs you receive. Tell your care team about any medications or supplements you are taking. Some may interact with chemotherapy. Maintenance therapy Maintenance therapy is the use of systemic therapy after successful initial treatment for ovarian cancer. It can reduce the risk of cancer returning or extend the time until it returns or gets worse. Maintenance therapy is an option for stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers that respond well to surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are a newer option for maintenance therapy after initial treatment. These oral targeted therapies work best in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)- positive cancers, including those caused by a BRCA mutation. PARP inhibitors currently used for maintenance therapy after initial treatment of ovarian cancer include: Olaparib (Lynparza) Niraparib (Zejula) Rucaparib (Rubraca) The most common side effects of PARP inhibitors are similar to those caused by chemotherapy. They include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and low blood cell counts. Rare but serious side effects include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myelodysplastic syndrome is a cancer in which the bone marrow does not make enough healthy blood cells. There are abnormal cells in the blood and/or bone marrow. Acute myeloid leukemia is a fast-growing disease in which too many immature white blood cells are found in the bone marrow and blood. In some cases MDS can become AML. If chemotherapy included bevacizumab For HR deficient cancers and BRCA-mutated cancers, maintenance therapy with both bevacizumab and olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) is a recommended option. If you can't have olaparib, niraparib is given instead. For BRCA-mutated cancers, maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor alone is also an option. Maintenance therapy with bevacizumab alone is also an option for cancers not caused by a BRCA mutation, or whose BRCA status is unknown. If chemotherapy didn’t include bevacizumab If you have a BRCA mutation and chemotherapy didn't include bevacizumab, maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor alone is recommended. For some stage 2 cancers with a BRCA mutation, observation may be an option. If you don't have a BRCA mutation (or have not had a BRCA test), maintenance therapy with niraparib or rucaparib may be an option, especially if the cancer is HRD-positive. Observation is also an option if there was a complete response to chemotherapy. This means there are no signs of cancer in the body. How long does maintenance therapy last? The length of maintenance therapy after initial treatment depends on the specific drug(s). Olaparib alone can be given for up to 2 years. Olaparib bevacizumab together can be given for up to 15 months, with the olaparib continued for up to 2 years total. Niraparib alone can be given for up to 3 years. Rucaparib alone can be given for up to 2 years. These recommendations can change with ongoing research. Keep in mind that any maintenance therapy will be stopped if the cancer grows or spreads. It will also be stopped if the side effects become too harsh or make it unsafe to continue. There isn",

It will also be stopped if the side effects become too harsh or make it unsafe to continue. There isn’t much research on maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor after initial treatment for stage 2 ovarian cancer. If your cancer is stage 2 and you are eligible for maintenance therapy, talk to your provider about your options. Surveillance When there are no signs of cancer after treatment, expect to see your oncologist on a regular basis for physical and pelvic exams. First 2 years: Every 2 to 4 months Next 3 years: Every 3 to 6 months After 5 years: Once a year Your provider may order blood and imaging tests if you develop symptoms or if there are other reasons to suspect relapse. If your CA-125 level (or other tumor marker) was high originally, it may be checked on a regular basis after treatment. In addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. See Chapter 5: Survivorship for more information. \"I truly believe that you have to go through something life changing, to gain something life affirming.\" – Ovarian cancer survivor Recurrence The return of cancer after treatment is called a recurrence, or a relapse. Symptoms can be a sign of recurrence. Tell your care team if you have any of these symptoms: h Pain or bloating in your pelvis or belly Unexplained weight loss Upset stomach Constipation Trouble eating or feeling full fast Fatigue Needing to urinate often or urgently The presence of specific biomarkers helps guide treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer. If testing for the following biomarkers hasn't already been done, it is recommended now: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status HER2 expression Microsatellite instability (MSI) Mismatch repair (MMR) Tumor mutational burden (TMB) BRAF V600E mutation Folate receptor alpha (FRα) RET mutations NTRK gene fusions Your doctor may choose to test for even more biomarkers than those listed. Everyone with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer is encouraged to consider a clinical trial for treatment. Platinum-resistant cancer Ovarian cancer is called platinum-resistant if: h It doesn’t improve or worsens during platinum-based chemotherapy, or It returns less than 6 months after successful treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Because platinum-based chemotherapy didn’t improve your cancer, a different type of recurrence treatment is recommended. Non-platinum chemotherapy is usually given first. Another preferred option is bevacizumab (Avastin). This may also be added to your chemotherapy. For tumors with the folate receptor alpha (FRα) biomarker, the targeted therapy mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (Elahere) is preferred for recurrence treatment. It is a type of antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Other options may include endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. These options are described more next. Enrolling in a clinical trial is encouraged if you are eligible. Platinum-sensitive cancer If you enter complete remission after platinumbased chemotherapy and cancer returns more than 6 months later, the cancer is considered platinum-sensitive. This means that platinumbased chemotherapy drugs work well against the cancer. Because it worked well before, platinum chemotherapy is typically recommended for recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. This is especially true for the first recurrence. The targeted therapy bevacizumab may be added to chemotherapy. In certain circumstances, before starting recurrence treatment, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove all visible cancer. This is called secondary cytoreductive surgery. If recurrence treatment with platinumbased chemotherapy works well or very well, maintenance therapy is an option. If bevacizumab was included in your recurrence chemotherapy regimen, it can be continued alone as maintenance therapy. A PARP inhibitor may also be an option for maintenance therapy, if you haven’t already been treated with one and there is a BRCA mutation. After successful chemotherapy for recurrent cancer, maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor can be continued until the cancer grows or spreads, or until the side effects make it intolerable or unsafe to continue. When used after recurrence treatment, the safety of maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor for longer than 2 years is unknown. Hypersensitivity reactions With repeat use of carboplatin and/or cisplatin, you are at increased risk of a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. This can be life-threatening. If your treatment team hasn’t brought it up, below are some questions you can ask to learn about this risk. How likely is it that I will have an allergic reaction to chemotherapy? How will I know if I’m having an allergic reaction? What are the symptoms? Does the staff on hand know how to manage hypersensitivity reactions? Will the right medical equipment be available in case I have an allergic reaction? Biomarker-based treatment If the cancer has any of the biomarkers listed in Guide 3 below, targeted therapy or immunotherapy may be an option. For information on the side effects of immunotherapy, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients Immunotherapy Side Effects: Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app.\nThroat cancer basics The throat The pharynx Head and neck cancers Throat cancer Key points The throat is located in the back of the mouth and in the neck.

Cancer can form in part of the throat called the oropharynx. The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of throat, and the base of the tongue. The throat The throat is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (the tube that goes to the stomach). The throat acts as a passageway for air to enter the lungs and food and liquid to enter the esophagus. It contains many structures, including the tonsils, pharynx, and larynx. Some important structures of the throat and mouth: Oral cavity is another name for mouth. Hard palate is the hard, front part of the roof of the mouth behind the teeth. Soft palate is the soft, back part of the roof of the mouth. Tongue includes several muscles that extend from your hyoid bone (located in the middle of your neck) to the floor of your mouth. Pharynx is the throat. Larynx is a specific part of the throat also known as the voice box. Esophagus is a hollow muscular tube that carries food and liquid to the stomach. Trachea or windpipe leads to the lungs. The pharynx The pharynx is part of the throat and starts behind the nose (nasal cavity) and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The pharynx (said fair-inks) has 3 parts: Nasopharynx Oropharynx Hypopharynx Cancer can be found in any part of the pharynx. This book will focus on cancer of the oropharynx and will refer to the oropharynx as the throat. The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of the throat, and the base of the tongue found in the throat. PartsoftheOropharynx The oropharynx The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of the throat, and the back (base) of the tongue. This book will refer to the oropharynx as the throat. The pharynx The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus. The pharynx has 3 parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. Anatomyof thePharynx Head and neck cancers Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Cancer is named and treated based on the tumor location or where the cancer started. Cancer can occur in the: Mouth (oral cavity), Middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), Space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), Upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), Voice box (larynx), or Lower part of the throat behind the larynx (hypopharynx). Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN or HNSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer. It forms in the thin, flat cells of the mucus membranes of the mouth (oral), nose (nasal), and throat (pharynx). Mucus is a thick, slippery fluid. Squamous cells are found throughout the body, including the skin. It is strongly recommended, when possible, for those with head and neck cancer to be treated at a high-volume center or hospital that has experience in their type of cancer. More information on mouth cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer can be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. Throat cancer Throat cancer starts in the oropharynx. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of throat cancer and is the focus of this book. Cancer cells form a tumor called a primary tumor within the area of the oropharynx. This area includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of throat, and base of the tongue. Tumors can grow into nearby tissue and organs, such as the voice box (larynx). Cancer cells often spread to lymph nodes in the neck, and less frequently, the lungs, liver, or spine. Key points Head and neck cancers are a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN or HNSCC) forms in the thin, flat cells of the mucus membranes of the mouth (oral), nose (nasal), and throat (pharynx). Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). SCC of the throat (oropharynx) is the focus of this book. The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of throat, and base of the tongue found in the throat. 2 Testing for throat cancer Test results General health tests Fertility (all genders) Preventing pregnancy during treatment p16 (HPV) testing Imaging tests Scoping procedures Biopsy Biomarker testing Key points Treatment planning starts with testing",
